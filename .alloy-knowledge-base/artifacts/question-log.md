# Question Log

## Q-001: What is the exact frequency of software releases?
- **Context**: Understanding release cadence is critical for planning automation tools and change management processes
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #38 indicates "approximately every two weeks" but this is uncertain and needs confirmation from Julia)

## Q-002: How long does each component actually take to complete?
- **Context**: Resource planning and timeline estimation for requirements documentation backlog
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #17 suggests "weeks" but this is a guess based on numerous TBDs)

## Q-003: What are the four types of gates in the release process?
- **Context**: Understanding the formal approval and quality control mechanisms in the development pipeline
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #58 hypothesizes integration gate, V&V gate, safety gate, and program gate, but their actual existence is unconfirmed)

## Q-004: Does the V-model process change require organizational paradigm shift beyond tooling?
- **Context**: Determining scope and complexity of implementing proper requirements-first development
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #68 suggests this is needed but remains hypothesis)

## Q-005: How does the feedback loop from vehicle operations actually work?
- **Context**: Understanding how real-world testing data influences requirements updates and development priorities
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #76 describes a "strong feedback loop" but details are hypothetical)

## Q-006: What is Toyota Motor Corporation's actual quarterly requirements delivery process?
- **Context**: Planning for requirements intake automation and version control
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #78 suggests quarterly delivery for stability but this is hypothesis)

## Q-007: Does Woven operate with waterfall methodology?
- **Context**: Understanding development process constraints and tool integration requirements
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #82 suggests waterfall due to company size but this is hypothesis)

## Q-008: What teams are involved in the development process integration?
- **Context**: Identifying all stakeholders for the integration management solution
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #83 mentions Foundation, SVNV, SEC teams but this is hypothesis)

## Q-009: Can Rectify address the requirements management needs?
- **Context**: Evaluating existing solutions before building new tools
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertions #33 and #122 mention Rectify as potential solution but evaluation hasn't been completed)

## Q-010: What is the precise current IP architecture documentation status?
- **Context**: Critical for Epic 2 architecture diagram generation and SCRD writing capability
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #167 indicates current architecture documentation "is not yet planned")

## Q-011: Can Julia Pralle and Eric Keranen's previous tool be reused?
- **Context**: Leveraging existing work for architecture diagram generation in Epic 2
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #169 suggests potential reuse but this is hypothesis)

## Q-012: How will the JP team's Reqtify tool integration work?
- **Context**: Avoiding duplication of effort and ensuring tool compatibility
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #163 indicates JP team wants to use Reqtify but integration approach is unclear)

## Q-013: What are the specific capabilities in the existing spreadsheet?
- **Context**: Leveraging existing documentation as foundation for comprehensive component checklist
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #1 mentions capabilities spreadsheet exists but contents are hypothesis)

## Q-014: How will the change request management weekly meetings operate?
- **Context**: Understanding the formal change control process for requirements updates
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #114 establishes weekly meetings but specific operational details are missing)

## Q-015: What are the exact ODD requirements from CA?
- **Context**: Ensuring complete feature documentation includes operating conditions
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertion #140 assigns Wendi to discuss with Tatson but answer not yet obtained)

## Q-016: How will the three contractor automation project integrate with existing work?
- **Context**: Coordinating multiple automation initiatives to avoid conflicts and maximize synergy
- **Status**: Open
- **Answer**: Pending (assertions #113 and #143 mention contractor project starting but integration approach unclear)
