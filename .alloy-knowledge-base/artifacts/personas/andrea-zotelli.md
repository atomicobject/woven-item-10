# Andrea Zotelli

**Role**: Requirements Engineer / Product Delivery Team Member

## Background

Andrea joined Woven by Toyota at the end of October 2024, working primarily on writing requirements and setting up structure in JAMA for systems verification and validation. She's dealing with a massive backlog of undocumented requirements for self-driving car software components and is writing component-level requirements from zero using scattered sources. She works within a complex multi-organizational structure involving Woven, Denso, and other companies in Toyota's 'one team' approach and serves as the primary stakeholder contact for Epic 1.

## Goals

- Set up proper structure in JAMA for systems verification and validation
- Write comprehensive component-level requirements from scattered sources
- Create consolidated documentation for autonomous vehicle software components
- Establish complete traceability overview for all incoming requirements
- Navigate requirements from Toyota Motor Corporation that require rewriting due to language and structural differences
- Serve as critical communication tool with customer TMC for requirements status

## Needs

- Consolidated view of all requirements across development teams
- Automated tools to reduce manual compilation effort
- Better visibility into requirement changes from development teams
- Streamlined process for gathering requirements into JAMA
- Precise understanding of current and planned future IP architecture versions
- Complete traceability overview for all incoming requirements
- Elimination of pain points in requirements version control and change management

## Frustrations

- Lack of consolidated information sources requiring constant searching through scattered documents
- Having to browse through multiple systems (Git repositories, spreadsheets, slides) manually
- No existing component requirements to build upon - starting from zero
- Navigating through spreadsheets with multiple links and fragmented information
- Requirements must be rewritten rather than translated due to language and module structure differences from Toyota Motor Corporation
- Lack of precise understanding of current IP architecture documentation, blocking ability to write lower-level requirements (SCRDs)

## Behaviors

- Manually compiles information from various sources into JAMA
- Searches through scattered documents, slides, scenarios, and spreadsheets
- Rewrites requirements rather than translating due to language and structural differences
- Browses Git repositories to gather technical information
- Creates concept maps and tables to organize team roles and processes (PDM, PD, CA, TMC)
- Participates in systems workshop sessions and stakeholder coordination
- Provides JAMA structure guidance to team members
