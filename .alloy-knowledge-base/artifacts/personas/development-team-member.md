# Development Team Member

**Role**: Software Developer (Perception, Braking, Lane Change, etc.)

## Background

Development team members work on specific autonomous vehicle components like perception, braking systems, and lane change functionality. They store requirements in various systems and make changes during development that need to be reflected back to central repositories. They operate within a complex multi-organizational structure involving multiple companies working as 'one team', with hundreds of contributors expected to work simultaneously across many years using GitHub's forked development model.

## Goals

- Develop and test autonomous vehicle software components
- Maintain accurate requirements for their specific domain
- Communicate requirement changes effectively to product delivery teams
- Ensure their requirements have proper test coverage

## Needs

- Centralized requirements tracking system
- Easy mechanism to update central repository with changes
- Visibility into requirement test status
- Better coordination with [[persona:Andrea Zotelli]] and product delivery teams
- Streamlined process for communicating requirement discoveries and changes

## Frustrations

- Requirements scattered across different systems (Confluence, GitHub, Google Docs, spreadsheets)
- No easy way to reflect requirement changes back to central repository
- Difficulty tracking whether requirements have passing or failing tests
- Lack of centralized visibility into cross-team requirements
- Discovery of issues during development (like billboards being incorrectly identified as mailboxes) that require requirement updates

## Behaviors

- Store requirements in domain-specific systems
- Make requirement changes during development cycles
- Work within multi-organizational team structure using forked development model
- Focus on component-specific development and testing
- Discover and report requirement issues during implementation
- Utilize vSpirit Slack channel for Vehicle Software Platform support
