**Dan Maser**: Sweet. Pretty good, just wrapping up some things for, nice, take your time, take your time.
*00:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, no, no, I WAS wrapping up some things. That is now complete.
*00:07*

**Dan Maser**: Nice. And… Is Nate… is Nate on another project, too, or no?
*00:11*

**Gus Schissler**: I… don't know. I don't think so.
*00:21*

**Dan Maser**: Okay. Yeah, that's why I felt bad when I was like, I really need to get to some other things, but I know you literally can't do anything without, like… Yeah, so. Alright, so I started poking in the mirror, I also started to, like, I went through that video, and I feel like it was fine. Like, the table's really helpful, but you can barely read it, and then they're just, like, very much talking wrap-up, so I did… I did text, or I did turn the whole thing into a Markdown file and put it into our Obsidian. I have no idea if that will… like, like, because you know how there was, like, 5 other pages in there, 7 other pages? I started to look through this, though, this looks good. So, I feel like, if I'm reading this correctly, like, these are… I'm gonna delete this, but, like, these are, like, these are… these are lanes, right? Perfect. And… okay. Cool. Sweet. Yeah.
*00:24*

**Gus Schissler**: Actually, keep those. Don't delete them.
*01:27*

**Dan Maser**: I… well, I… I was being anal, and .
*01:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, if you want to organize it, you can organize it.
*01:33*

**Dan Maser**: No, no, this is good for now. I was also wondering if we might want to, like, color code the stickies, given, like, who the… who's doing the action, but we can figure that out.
*01:36*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, it does not matter to me.
*01:45*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, okay, so, I really like this, like, is this the correct understanding of the flow? So… Do you wanna talk it out? Gross.
*01:48*

**Gus Schissler**: One second, I'll raise you one better.
*02:04*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*02:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Wait, are you kidding me? Ugh.
*02:14*

**Dan Maser**: What's wrong.
*02:16*

**Gus Schissler**: I forgot that, Question. When you did your, when you were collaborating with Wovi, was it… on the sidebar, did you have global chat selected, or internal chat?
*02:18*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, are you talking about, like… Are you talking, like, the web one web search? I… Don't remember… I have it off right now. I turned it on at one point in time, I think… I think when I was on the plane doing it, I had it on, and now I've been using it off. What, yeah.
*02:35*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm asking about, on the… on the full sidebar. Here. I… I'd show my screen, but I'm about to… I'd have to leave.
*03:02*

**Dan Maser**: No, you're good. On the full… oh, oh, Global Chat! Yes, global chat.
*03:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. That doesn't have any of their internal documentation attached to it, I think it's just…
*03:17*

**Dan Maser**: Cool. That's not helpful at all.
*03:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, the internal chat, the tab right underneath that, does have access to some other things.
*03:25*

**Dan Maser**: Do you… did you get access to it?
*03:31*

**Gus Schissler**: Internal chat?
*03:34*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*03:35*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. Do you not have access to it?
*03:36*

**Dan Maser**: No, it says to fill out a form. It… it… I'm getting a, please fill out… Please fill out the contractor's form to request it. That's dumb. Okay, I'll do that. Okay, so you're, you're actually, like, you actually have tools. Okay.
*03:38*

**Gus Schissler**: I must have… requested that access, I guess.
*03:55*

**Dan Maser**: I mean, you should have requested, that's super smart, so… I'm gonna do that right now. Because you're right, we totally should be using it internally, because Global Chat… Global Chat feels like it's probably just what I was using it for, where it's just, like, basically a more locked-down version of…
*03:59*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*04:17*

**Dan Maser**: Without really helping at all. Cool.
*04:18*

**Gus Schissler**: Today?
*04:23*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, sweet. No, so you were using internal chat, so I will 100% believe more of what you're looking at, yeah.
*04:25*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh. So, the reason I ask this is… I kind of want to feed that blueprint that we have.
*04:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*04:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Back into it.
*04:47*

**Dan Maser**: And then see if it has…
*04:48*

**Gus Schissler**: Thoughts or understanding about what's actually there.
*04:51*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, that's a good idea. We would need to turn this into a diagram.
*04:55*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm getting a call from California, which… I don't know why that would be woven, but I'm gonna take it.
*05:04*

**Dan Maser**: Just take it. I'm filling out this request anyways. So, hey Nate.
*05:10*

**Nathan Papes**: Hey.
*05:13*

**Dan Maser**: Let me just… One second… Okay. Okay, sweet. How's your day been?
*05:15*

**Nathan Papes**: Good. I've been actually just mostly working on a spin post. That's due.
*05:40*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, dude, that's smart.
*05:47*

**Nathan Papes**: Has to, actually.
*05:48*

**Dan Maser**: Where do you live again?
*05:49*

**Nathan Papes**: Ann Arbor.
*05:52*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, sweet!
*05:53*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, I'm right, I'm… Probably, like, 2 miles from the office.
*05:54*

**Dan Maser**: I guess so.
*05:59*

**Nathan Papes**: I gotta start biking to work. That's what I need to do. Gotta bike and everything.
*06:00*

**Dan Maser**: I love it. Anyway, do you bike to work, or no?
*06:10*

**Nathan Papes**: No, no. I have, like, a bike, and a helmet, everything to do it, just haven't committed to ever doing it. But my goal for, like, the spring, when the weather gets nicer, I have no excuses. Also, who is the owner of the mural board?
*06:13*

**Dan Maser**: Gus, do you not have access?
*06:38*

**Nathan Papes**: I requested it, so what should happen is, I should be able to at least have read-only view.
*06:40*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah, we'll get you full access.
*06:47*

**Nathan Papes**: And then full access, if that's what we're gonna use for, like, the main…
*06:49*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, at the very least, just for right now, we'll use it. Gus.
*06:53*

**Gus Schissler**: feedback.
*06:57*

**Dan Maser**: Gosh, can you give Nate… well, Nate can talk for himself. Can you give access to Nate to the, Miro board, though?
*06:59*

**Nathan Papes**: It should be… it should be in your email, like, there should be, like, hey, nathan.papis at Atomic Objects.
*07:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, did you, I'm assuming you requested a seat already?
*07:11*

**Nathan Papes**: I'm going… I'm… I'm gonna do that in, like, one bulk request for… Okay. But I think… I think how it works is you get read-only access.
*07:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Maybe…
*07:24*

**Nathan Papes**: the free…
*07:25*

**Gus Schissler**: It shows I have some… I've gotten, like, the… the billing in, Miro is really weird, that… I can… what I can do, though, is give you this link. I've talked with Josh about this before, because I've, accidentally… Added, like, 10 seats.
*07:29*

**Nathan Papes**: Boy.
*07:50*

**Gus Schissler**: the mural, and it's billed… It's prorated immediately, and it's billed all at once, so… But I did give you guest access, so we should be cleared for… Yes, yes.
*07:51*

**Nathan Papes**: Yep, I can see, I can see you guys. Alright.
*08:04*

**Gus Schissler**: And then I just realized, Dan, that, sure, there may be a chat. Interface, but you're not allowed to upload images.
*08:09*

**Dan Maser**: Aww, well, that's okay, we can translate it. We could probably translate it.
*08:20*

**Gus Schissler**: You know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna open… Yeah. I'm gonna install Claude, and then ask Claude to… Convert my screenshot into a text-based…
*08:28*

**Dan Maser**: I also have a prompt for it with Opus. I could try that too, but yeah, see what you get. Whoa. We'll have a little, we'll have a fun little.
*08:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Hey, how y'all. AI Duel.
*08:52*

**Dan Maser**: Shit, this knowledge base doesn't have the AI toolkit set up next to it. Fuck me. Okay, you're gonna win. Alright… Let's see what you get. I'm there. You're gonna… you're gonna win it. Okay.
*08:55*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't know. I don't know what my admin name and password are. Sure, I can't… What the fuck? I do have admin access, though. Oh. Oh.
*09:25*

**Dan Maser**: To pick… oh, I've got the script right here, man. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I got it. Give it a good agent. Okay…
*09:39*

**Gus Schissler**: So strange. It must have just timed out.
*10:07*

**Dan Maser**: Alright, well, I'm dropping the screenshot already, so here we go. Here's the reality, I don't know if I'll understand it, but… It's going.
*10:13*

**Nathan Papes**: The way to burn up your, tokens.
*10:38*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, baby. I don't even know how many tokens I use, I don't look into that. Probably should.
*10:41*

**Nathan Papes**: Opus… Opus with images? Oh, yeah.
*10:48*

**Dan Maser**: It's not username, oh, yeah, yeah.
*10:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, you're using Opus?
*10:53*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. Pretty easy.
*10:54*

**Gus Schissler**: sauna. Okay, I got it. Are you in Claude Desktop, or are you in.
*10:58*

**Dan Maser**: I'm encouraged her.
*11:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, okay. Cool. I'm gonna quit my Zoom and rejoin.
*11:10*

**Nathan Papes**: Yep.
*11:26*

**Gus Schissler**: Because I need to share my screen. Cool. Okay.
*11:28*

**Dan Maser**: Test and flow, okay.
*11:52*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm just gonna share it. Everything. Sorry if mine… This MacBook is fucking huge. I actually did use Opus. So, since you guys don't have access to… Whoa V. I'm just gonna continue my chat from yesterday.
*11:55*

**Dan Maser**: Here's what I got. Where do you want it?
*12:19*

**Gus Schissler**: Let's put it in a Slack thread or something, I guess. I'm just curious about which output you got.
*12:21*

**Dan Maser**: I… what… how do you want it? Do you want that in a Markdown file, or in text?
*12:29*

**Gus Schissler**: I just put the… I mean, the text is the markdown? Like, if you copy it from there, it'll paste as Markdown into Slack, I think.
*12:33*

**Dan Maser**: That's a good point. Okay. Here you go. Let's see. Let's see who it struggles with the most. Oh, it's over… it's over… not capacity, I'm putting it in Slack. Too much text.
*12:41*

**Gus Schissler**: What did you generate?
*13:00*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*13:02*

**Dan Maser**: this. Not that much. It's just… you can only do a thousand characters in… in.
*13:03*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't think this was a thousand characters, no. Okay, anyway, like, what we're looking at right now is just… it was able to, The… it's got sources, so someone's…
*13:13*

**Dan Maser**: Nice.
*13:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, the actual… Oh, this will be useful, terms, definitions, and acronyms.
*13:31*

**Nathan Papes**: Yes, yeah.
*13:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Don't know if I can share this chat with you folks… Bookmarks? I don't know. Oh, cool. Sweet. I'm assuming it knows what it's talking about.
*13:39*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. Well, that's why we're verifying this.
*13:58*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep. Customer need… Product turns needs into product-level requirements and success criteria. This is where user requirements diagram… I forget what SB is.
*14:01*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, I just… I was just looking this up. Sorry, give me… give me 30 seconds. S… which one?
*14:18*

**Gus Schissler**: SB, with a As in boy.
*14:27*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, maybe I missed… oh, S… oh, BRD or SBRD?
*14:32*

**Gus Schissler**: SBRD. Cool.
*14:36*

**Dan Maser**: Soft system baseline Requirements Doc. So it's a top.
*14:47*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. You're step 1 and 2 implicitly combine several actors. Oh, this is helpful. It's not just product alone. I don't know what CA is, but… Customer assurance, maybe? I don't know.
*14:53*

**Dan Maser**: You could… you can ask it. Yeah. Change assessment.
*15:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. Feasibility and V model alignment… okay, this makes sense. The draft jumps too quickly between Product spits out work to dev teams do sprints, which makes sense.
*15:22*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*15:38*

**Gus Schissler**: There's a system or software requirements layer. Okay, so people are initially… creating… structured requirements in JAMA, I assume.
*15:39*

**Dan Maser**: We can ask it that. So is that the extra layer, or…
*15:58*

**Gus Schissler**: a couple extra layers here. I mean, we're not asking it, it's telling us that what we need to do is ask Andrea, is this actually…
*16:02*

**Dan Maser**: What you folks are doing.
*16:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm… So at the repo layer, apparently teams do release stuff to their… Do you make releases at the repo level?
*16:15*

**Dan Maser**: And that's with development teams?
*16:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes. And then there's a product delivery heavy phase. So this is kind of the… the area that I think we're…
*16:32*

**Dan Maser**: Missing.
*16:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, not missing, but here to help with.
*16:42*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yes. Yeah, because I think… because your thing has it released to vehicles, and I think it misses the SIM part. Correct.
*16:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep.
*16:57*

**Dan Maser**: So, I think that vehicles might be the wrong word. Because I, I think… There might be two steps, they might sim it in their own, but also I think they sim the whole integrated part.
*17:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I would assume so.
*17:13*

**Dan Maser**: I'm just adding some potential notes based off of this onto the dialogue, but I'm putting them in different colors. Okay, keep going.
*17:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Sorry, I'm scrolling back up. So… You got, devs doing releases at the repo level, but here, I can see you're super close to your screen, I can make this bigger.
*17:26*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, it's okay, yeah, I'm just working on two screens.
*17:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, let's do this even better. Cool.
*17:42*

**Dan Maser**: So it says it's not…
*17:51*

**Gus Schissler**: So these are all different teams, I think.
*17:53*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*17:56*

**Gus Schissler**: Foundation, SVNV…
*17:57*

**Dan Maser**: I've seen SEC a trillion times. Yeah.
*18:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*18:03*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, and triage before anything gets to vehicle. So you say these are 3 separate gates.
*18:06*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't think they're gates. I think people are doing all of these things at the same time, but that could be a… Good.
*18:13*

**Dan Maser**: I'm just drawing it up… I'm drawing it up this way, I think, how I understand it, and we can just…
*18:21*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. Sweet.
*18:26*

**Dan Maser**: And I think then it goes.
*18:28*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, if you're doing that, then why don't I just…
*18:29*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, it might be best. I was just putting in red. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*18:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Sorry, I gotta move your faces again.
*18:47*

**Dan Maser**: Dude, move any of my shit.
*18:50*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, it's just that all of our faces, not necessarily the stuff in here. So I think these teams might be more in this area of, like.
*18:53*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you're totally right. Let's blow this up a little, not blow it up, make it larger. I just… No, blow it up.
*19:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Load up.
*19:14*

**Dan Maser**: I wasn't even thinking about that, I was just trying to, like, move it, like, I wasn't trying to focus on it yet, but I think we should… Make these a little bit bigger to fit them, because you're 100% right, they would not be below the… like, they would not be… on development teams. These are probably… would these be… Well, this might be breaking the grid, because these aren't… Well, is this for the product level that these are happening, or…
*19:15*

**Gus Schissler**: That was my assumption. Like, there, of course, like, what's in here is, like. Just a middle field, which is, like, it's product… not only product management, but it's also product delivery.
*19:43*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, I'm just getting rid of… I preserved the other one, but yeah. Oh, I see, you can put this in here. Okay, so… I don't know if it's, like, a linear gate, or it's, like, all three have to approve, but it sounds like there's some kind of a…
*19:55*

**Gus Schissler**: Just chuckling at your.
*20:17*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah. All of them.
*20:19*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. Okay. The model and charter emphasize a strong feedback loop. Vehicle operations and tests collect data, issues, and performance metrics. That's what you were talking about this morning, Nate. So there's, like, the, okay, now that we have this new feature, go test it. Then there's, like, a triage… And I think this is, like, validation verification, or verification and…
*20:22*

**Dan Maser**: I'm on it. I'm on it.
*20:56*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. So they, based on the test results, they triage issues.
*20:57*

**Dan Maser**: And this isn't… this isn't drive… this is not driver triage, right? This is, like, triage within this… Correct.
*21:03*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm, be it.
*21:13*

**Dan Maser**: VNV means verification and Validation.
*21:14*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, so… what I'm thinking is… like, this… It's not just code gets released to a vehicle, this is, like, code goes into a test vehicle thing, and then vehicle operations and testing Tests that new feature.
*21:18*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, so this does include that step, because this is the entire…
*21:37*

**Gus Schissler**: I would assume so, but I don't know.
*21:41*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*21:45*

**Gus Schissler**: And then the triage team helps generate evaluation reports. And then the product team will use these metrics to update Or, like, requirements, definitions, and plan…
*21:46*

**Dan Maser**: which step are we on right now? Because I thought we were… I thought we were over here, but we're not over… because there's this… I was over here. But these are separate than… The three that you're looking at.
*22:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, that's correct. So, after Teams release code… .
*22:14*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, who's putting it into JAMA? That's what we're at. So I think we're in right here.
*22:25*

**Gus Schissler**: This thing. Product foundation, release triage, can I turn this into a sticky?
*22:31*

**Dan Maser**: I'm just gonna, for the sake of right now, while we're talking, this is my visual brain, I'm just gonna… we're gonna have a little sticky for where we're talking about in the process, because that'll help me.
*22:42*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. So, once the teams are… this is your sticky here.
*22:53*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. Yup.
*22:59*

**Gus Schissler**: So… this. Once the teams are ready, then the code goes to these people.
*23:01*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, we might need to redo the visual, because it's like, the yellow is what they're doing, right? Is this… Integrate, test, and gate. So are they… are they gathering requirements, test, or criteria, or no?
*23:15*

**Gus Schissler**: That is the… that's my… what I think the real question is, like, when they say they want to take all of these different requirements that are floating around, and put them into a unified place in JAMA, Is that… A single activity that they do once.
*23:29*

**Dan Maser**: Or is that just something that they do continuously throughout this entire flow? Yeah, because we're dealing… we're dealing with who's… oh, sweet. I think I might have gotten access. Yeah, because we're dealing with what and who now, which makes sense.
*23:50*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*24:11*

**Dan Maser**: And I get what you're saying. Are they doing something at a singular spot, or are they… yeah.
*24:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. So, this is, like, all these three teams, I think, are doing integrating testing and deciding if things are ready to go. And then, I'm assuming… I'm gonna break this…
*24:23*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I'm… dude, you break things as much… this is… this is an active document.
*24:40*

**Gus Schissler**: So this is a gate, so either… Code is ready to deploy. Or… Updated. Requirements… Can we, just remove the teams from the swim lane for this point?
*24:47*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, time. Totally.
*25:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Boy ahead, Ian.
*25:17*

**Dan Maser**: Honestly, it's… yeah, it's… it's more complex than sticky notes, but we can, yeah.
*25:21*

**Gus Schissler**: Where'd those… did you just delete them? did.
*25:27*

**Dan Maser**: That's it.
*25:30*

**Gus Schissler**: You can undelete them, probably.
*25:30*

**Dan Maser**: No, I can just… I'll just put them…
*25:31*

**Gus Schissler**: That's, like, the… what I would say…
*25:37*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*25:47*

**Gus Schissler**: Needs updated requirements…
*25:51*

**Dan Maser**: So, who are the teams again? Oh.
*25:54*

**Gus Schissler**: It was beautiful. There's a whole… there… I think there are way too many teams to start outlining them in this.
*26:00*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, so these are the individual teams. Okay, this is each team. Okay, I thought it was a separate group. That's why I was trying to document it. Okay, I get what you're saying.
*26:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, what we'll probably need is a… some sort of, like… Business or organization relationship map, which they probably have already, which…
*26:15*

**Dan Maser**: yup.
*26:27*

**Gus Schissler**: If you got internal chat, you could probably ask it if it has, like, a… Organization map, an org map. Because maybe they do.
*26:28*

**Dan Maser**: map.
*26:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*26:38*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, dude, well, it said I just got access, but now, when I click on that, I don't, so let me see… let's keep going.
*26:41*

**Gus Schissler**: You might have to refresh.
*26:46*

**Dan Maser**: added.
*26:47*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm…
*26:49*

**Dan Maser**: I approve the request. Okay. Cool. You recruit the request?
*26:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, someone still has to, like, go through and, like, actually check that box, I guess.
*26:55*

**Dan Maser**: I get it. Yup. Okay. Forgot about working on a big company. Okay, keep going.
*27:01*

**Gus Schissler**: So…
*27:06*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, no, I got it, I got it, I got it.
*27:09*

**Gus Schissler**: They're cool.
*27:11*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, so what did you want me to ask? .
*27:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Just ask it if there's a org chart For the different teams.
*27:15*

**Dan Maser**: Within Woven, do you have an org chart for the different… I'm wondering what teams these are, if I can give it more… it's like… they're like engineering teams, right?
*27:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, no, I want, like, all teams. We're trying to find a list of all the different teams that have a role in this, service diagram.
*27:31*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, okay. Let's see how this does.
*27:40*

**Gus Schissler**: Size a strong feedback loop…
*27:49*

**Dan Maser**: It's taking some time to think. Org tree and success factors. He doesn't have access to it.
*27:57*

**Gus Schissler**: There's a product delivery… Onboarding comfo and stock, which will probably be helpful to read. Sweet. Oh, I've got.
*28:24*

**Dan Maser**: I've got…
*28:39*

**Gus Schissler**: I might disconnect slightly as I start the VPN real quick.
*28:41*

**Dan Maser**: I think I might have enough here to go off of.
*28:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay… Hopefully. Sweet, I'm connected.
*29:29*

**Dan Maser**: Even let me refresh…
*29:39*

**Gus Schissler**: I should be able to access… Hell yeah, this is what I wanted.
*29:41*

**Dan Maser**: You got in?
*29:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, it's a, confluence. like, org chart as of November 2025, that's not that bad. Oh.
*29:53*

**Dan Maser**: I was looking at… I'm looking at something similar.
*30:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Viewer? Quest access…
*30:05*

**Dan Maser**: Check.
*30:12*

**Gus Schissler**: So it looks like there's a hole woven… ADAS org.
*30:12*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I'm on that page here. I'm sending it to you right now, you have Slack, right?
*30:18*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*30:22*

**Dan Maser**: I'm just gonna send it to you, so you have the… because you're screen sharing, too. I just sent it to you. Oh, I'm sorry, I DM'd you by accident. Not… yeah.
*30:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Maybe fine.
*30:30*

**Dan Maser**: I also took screenshots of all of that. Not… sorry, yep.
*30:33*

**Gus Schissler**: There we go.
*30:40*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, sorry.
*30:45*

**Gus Schissler**: Boop-de-doo…
*30:47*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, shit, wait, we have access to all of it.
*30:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Access to all of what?
*30:53*

**Dan Maser**: Go to Complete Oregon's Success Factors. Click it. We'll be back next. Including where you are.
*30:54*

**Gus Schissler**: We might not need…
*31:03*

**Dan Maser**: org chart.
*31:08*

**Gus Schissler**: So I don't necessarily want the people kind of thing. What I want is just, like…
*31:12*

**Dan Maser**: Company structure overview? Yeah…
*31:19*

**Gus Schissler**: work on it. Where is that?
*31:22*

**Dan Maser**: Click on that link at the top. That. Yep. And then, top… yep, above direct… like, see the… there.
*31:25*

**Gus Schissler**: No selection. Woven by Toyota. Why do I feel like this should… Company?
*31:39*

**Dan Maser**: Got it. Except it's not. Oh, search, no selection. Do we want… Team? Sub function? Division?
*31:51*

**Gus Schissler**: It might not be worth to actually dive into this right now, is what I'm thinking. This isn't… what I was hoping is that they just had, like, a image somewhere that would be easy to understand. But the… I'm going to… I'm gonna bookmark this for later.
*31:59*

**Dan Maser**: I might have gotten something helpful…
*32:18*

**Gus Schissler**: Product delivery onboarding… That's not as helpful, I don't think.
*32:24*

**Dan Maser**: I think I might have… Something… Shit. And I hit back out of it by accident. There's nothing I hate more than the back button, like, the back swipe that's by default loaded in.
*32:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm, Okay. But, anyway, returning back to… hair… Which gets released to vehicle… What I'm thinking of is… Here, what workspace am I in right now? Let's do this.
*32:45*

**Dan Maser**: I think I've got something…
*33:32*

**Gus Schissler**: It might be helpful to fill this out.
*33:35*

**Dan Maser**: Come to FigJam?
*33:40*

**Gus Schissler**: No, I don't want to go to this fig jam.
*33:41*

**Dan Maser**: What do you want to do? What do you want to do?
*33:44*

**Gus Schissler**: There we go. Oopa-doop.
*33:47*

**Dan Maser**: I think we have access.
*33:57*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't want JAS, I want this one. So this is… I'll show you guys what I'm thinking would be really useful to build out. like, not before we talk with Andrea tomorrow, but from a… A general… This is, like, an example for BidConnect, but…
*34:04*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*34:32*

**Gus Schissler**: This is… In relation to the thing that we're working on, who are the people influenced by the thing that we're working on? And then… This ecosystem diagram is, like, okay, here are the people doing the things, and here's how these things are flowing in between them.
*34:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*34:55*

**Gus Schissler**: And the different tools that we use. And then this is kind of, like, the extent that like, I find useful behind a service blueprint, so we start with, like, the people that we've identified before, and then we talk, like, it's, like, left to right as we talk through, like, what actually happens. So what we're doing right now is really just the baby steps to that, and I think there are two… two major areas that we need to talk about with Andrea, at least to get a lay of the land. One is, who are the… Who are the… Major players that will interact. With the thing we're building… Then the other is… What's the process for gathering requirements? into Java. Right now. Because what we've got here, like, I don't doubt that this is probably a rough approximation of, okay, from the beginning all the way through, like, testing and things ready to deploy, but I… in… in what we've talked about today, I don't think, like, this gather requirements and testing stuff is, like, a single point in time. I think it's, like, a running… Task that they all do continuously.
*34:56*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*36:32*

**Gus Schissler**: And so they're… Anytime there's a change, I would say they're probably repeating this mini-process.
*36:33*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*36:41*

**Gus Schissler**: So it's… it'd be helpful to understand Almost like the mini… mini-journey there of, like, what… What do they do right now? How do they know that they need to update a change? Stuff like that. If that makes sense.
*36:42*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*37:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Exactly that. Do you still need this lollipop? Is it a lollipop?
*37:08*

**Dan Maser**: No, it's a… that's a map pin, but I'll let… I'll let you think it's a lollipop. I was just trying to keep it straight when you were, we are going through it. Oh, sweet, she did send us the concept map. That's awesome. That's big.
*37:14*

**Gus Schissler**: the concept map. Could you say that one more time?
*37:36*

**Dan Maser**: The thing… the map in the… if you look in your Slack, just go to your Slack, it's the thing that they were going through. Yep.
*37:39*

**Gus Schissler**: How cool! Boy.
*37:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. Mostly I wanted the table, because I know they're going through the table as well.
*37:58*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*38:07*

**Dan Maser**: I know there's a SIM part here. Okay…
*38:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*38:24*

**Dan Maser**: So I think CATMC, are those all the different teams, it looks like? Yeah.
*38:27*

**Gus Schissler**: One more… oh, these ones?
*38:32*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*38:34*

**Gus Schissler**: DRI, to me, is Directly Responsible Individual, so I wonder if these could be abbreviations for someone's name, too? But I don't know why…
*38:38*

**Dan Maser**: Well, TMC is the… that's the repo, right? Or that's the name of one of them? No. I mean, TMC is Toyota Motor Company. Yep, okay. Yep.
*38:47*

**Gus Schissler**: So I'm assuming… so PDM is product management, PD is… Product delivery. I do wonder what CA is.
*38:57*

**Dan Maser**: Remember we looked it up earlier, and I think it was change?
*39:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Customer application.
*39:25*

**Dan Maser**: The Toyota Customer Application Team.
*39:26*

**Gus Schissler**: Internal product application, systems verification and Validation. JP is… Japan.
*39:32*

**Dan Maser**: That makes sense. Okay, so…
*39:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool, okay.
*39:44*

**Dan Maser**: Totally.
*39:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Apparently, Nick is going to Japan.
*39:47*

**Dan Maser**: be real.
*39:51*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't… well, that's what it says here.
*39:52*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*39:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay, so… What's bothering me is, like, this table is… It's multiple tables wrapped up into one. Cause, like, these two things are together. Test plan, cases stored, responsible team… And then… I wonder what… What a bev… what the BEV repo is.
*39:56*

**Dan Maser**: No idea.
*40:25*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, and then they have how they test. That makes sense. If it's simulation, if it's in-vehicle, if it's…
*40:26*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah.
*40:32*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*40:36*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. Okay, so… and then we get to… Oh, yeah. System requirements… Software requirements, okay, this makes sense. I wanna know… What is this image? Because I think, Nate, this is what you'll… be working on, maybe?
*40:38*

**Nathan Papes**: That's, like, the… I mean, it looks like there's, like, sensors and stuff, like, kind of how the whole…
*41:10*

**Gus Schissler**: They're probably different.
*41:18*

**Nathan Papes**: things work?
*41:18*

**Gus Schissler**: to… oh, wait. Something… I don't know. It's so pixelated. I wonder what image this is, or what this says. But they… I assume that these are either, like, different… Teams are different parts of the organization. And then as we get further down to when they're actually building, like, a actual software component. Is when we get to, like, sensors and… data and databases and things like that, I assume. It would be interesting, and I know we got… this… I think this whole thing would make much more sense if we had that meeting today, because I don't know… When they're talking about getting an architecture diagram, what level that's at.
*41:19*

**Nathan Papes**: Yam.
*42:05*

**Gus Schissler**: I would assume it's one of these two, since, like. There's probably not a ton of use for the software component level, and the teams are probably making those on their own anyway. But, yeah, that'll be interesting to get solved on Monday. Cool. Okay. Thanks for asking Andrea, for this.
*42:06*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*42:31*

**Gus Schissler**: Dan.
*42:31*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, of course.
*42:33*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. Okay. So, this is the big… this is question one, right, from your questions, or section one, from your questions, like, this is the answer.
*42:34*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, this is Section 1… sorry, I was just downloading this file, too, and poking around in it, via PDF. Yes, just, like, getting… I'm wondering, are we missing any parts that we need? Or should we take… I mean, we have more time to go through it.
*42:48*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean, to be honest, like, the…
*43:09*

**Dan Maser**: They should be onboarding us to this? No.
*43:14*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah. Yeah, something…
*43:17*

**Gus Schissler**: But it's… I mean, it's… it could be… just be a file where… oh, wait.
*43:21*

**Nathan Papes**: Or process chart.
*43:27*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, sorry.
*43:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, there's Japanese?
*43:31*

**Nathan Papes**: Process tasks… Okay, okay.
*43:35*

**Dan Maser**: This looks like a…
*43:39*

**Nathan Papes**: idea.
*43:40*

**Dan Maser**: This looks like a glossary.
*43:45*

**Gus Schissler**: No, this is, like, their.
*43:49*

**Nathan Papes**: Software Architecture Design.
*43:52*

**Gus Schissler**: So, you have to keep in mind that we're working with a huge, old company, so they do things hella waterfall, I think.
*43:53*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, oh yeah, oh, for sure, yeah.
*44:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Meaning that each one of these steps probably has to be complete before the next step can start. Unless they've specifically outlined which… which things can happen.
*44:04*

**Dan Maser**: So that's… I feel like that's where we're getting to this, correct? Also, do you want me to switch it to FigJam, and we can just take… so that we can just duplicate what we have right now? From BigConnect, we can do that later.
*44:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, I mean, it'll be really quick to stand up that stuff. There might even be some artifacts that someone's prepped, I think, that I found that I could just repurpose. So I don't…
*44:27*

**Dan Maser**: We're excited.
*44:40*

**Gus Schissler**: So yeah, this is… Part of me wants to… Export this. And have Claude walk me through it.
*44:42*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. At the very least. I did drop this in here.
*45:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Thank you.
*45:10*

**Dan Maser**: Is the table even helpful? Maybe.
*45:12*

**Nathan Papes**: I mean, it's… This… that table looks useful, and that PDF looked useful to me. I guess all those links that were in there, like, that's what I would want to get, like, a dump of. Once I have… I'm guessing that's the, like, proprietary, sensitive stuff.
*45:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, this is all the… I think I have to be connected to their VPN in order to access some of this stuff, like any of the Confluence stuff you do.
*45:34*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*45:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Terms, definitions, and acronyms looks like a good thing to bookmark.
*45:43*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, those… those three… yeah, okay, like… That whole list of files, I think… This is gonna be, like, the gold mine for me, at least.
*45:47*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, yeah.
*45:58*

**Nathan Papes**: how I'd approach it. Internal… control pro… yep, there's their change management process. E0, Epic Planning.
*45:59*

**Gus Schissler**: Wow, no joke, like, Confluence, Slack, Google, more Slack.
*46:17*

**Nathan Papes**: Say.
*46:23*

**Gus Schissler**: This is all over the place. I mean, ours is probably the same, too, if we… But we have so many projects, I guess, it doesn't actually matter. Someone, someone gotta stick up their ass and wrote, Importance of Requirements, I think.
*46:23*

**Nathan Papes**: Someone hires some damn.
*46:39*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, so this one…
*46:40*

**Gus Schissler**: Whoa, wait, whoa, wait.
*46:41*

**Dan Maser**: This, this picture was in their wrap-up.
*46:44*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, is it?
*46:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, if you go to the conversation that they had, they must have used this as a baseline. Because I think, Gus, to your point, what's interesting is, like, this is for Toyota Motor Company in general, but Woven doesn't have as defined aspects of this, I believe, correct? Because Woven's significantly smaller?
*46:49*

**Gus Schissler**: I… so… I don't know, that's an assumption. I think what, did you pop that? This thing. I think they… when, in that recap, they built this.
*47:11*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. And they modeled it off of the picture that you're looking at, I believe, because that's… if you look at the… that big conference that they did, they have this picture in there.
*47:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. But this might just be a single Teams… Where are we? Departments, product delivery. Yeah, this is a single Teams…
*47:36*

**Dan Maser**: Here you go. Requirements strategy, requirements example… Where did they have it? No, you're right, they didn't have it. They had another example in there, they didn't have that. Month.
*47:47*

**Gus Schissler**: But this could be something where, like, this team, it looks like verification and validation built their own process, and… I haven't read through it, it's kind of hard to under… Understand… But, like, the point being… I don't know… this… we might be barking up the wrong tree in a way, I think.
*48:06*

**Dan Maser**: Oh yeah, here, I found it, yeah. Requirement structure between BEV, AD, and IP, it's listed here. In these notes.
*48:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*48:52*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I kind of… I think I'm getting what you're saying, where it's like, yeah, we weren't onboarded to any of this, so, like, we don't really know what's relevant and what's not.
*48:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Right. So I think this is… if we flushed out this picture, and then I assume that these two stickies, Dan.
*49:00*

**Dan Maser**: Can we talk with them.
*49:08*

**Gus Schissler**: Andrea, tomorrow. Probably turn into maybe 5 or 6.
*49:09*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. Because we'll…
*49:15*

**Gus Schissler**: not only do we want to stand… understand, like, the big picture, but we oughta… Section 2 of your questions is just, okay, but what about…
*49:16*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*49:28*

**Gus Schissler**: But how does product delivery fit into all of this? At each point. So… to that end… Are you editing this file right now, I wonder? I'm gonna change some of this stuff. Oh. It disappeared.
*49:28*

**Nathan Papes**: Bye.
*50:28*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm.
*51:58*

**Dan Maser**: Hey, I'm sorry about that, can you hear me?
*54:18*

**Nathan Papes**: opportunities?
*54:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Is your computer die?
*54:21*

**Dan Maser**: No, oh, did you see? My power kept turning, like, flickering on and off.
*54:23*

**Gus Schissler**: No shit.
*54:28*

**Dan Maser**: So, my monitor disconnected, and I was like, what the heck? And then… and then my internet… but then it was annoying, because it did it, like, 4 different times, so my internet would keep, like… Turn… you know, it kept stalling out, basically, when it was trying to reconnect, so… I hope that's gone.
*54:28*

**Gus Schissler**: I have a nice little neighborhood…
*54:44*

**Dan Maser**: some neighborhood friends who it was all happening to them as well, so I'm assuming… I have no idea what was going on. Anyways, yeah, I was… I see you guys are doing what I was gonna advocate for us to do anyways. Okay, cool.
*54:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Because I think we don't need to necessarily send…
*54:58*

**Dan Maser**: No.
*55:02*

**Gus Schissler**: All of these questions?
*55:03*

**Dan Maser**: Nope.
*55:06*

**Gus Schissler**: But I think the general flow is…
*55:07*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. And I think you're doing a really great job, I really like how you structured this, where I think it's really smart that, you know, we're talking, like, we've been… we've been getting notes and some onboarding stuff from Wovee, but also, we really haven't done any real onboarding, so, yeah. Also, yeah, there's a lot of shit on this document, and we can clean it up, or make it… yeah, we need to organize all this, but this… Thank you for doing this.
*55:12*

**Gus Schissler**: But you're good. Go over what's missing, what do we do have, what do we have wrong? And we'll discuss how product delivery plays a role throughout the process.
*55:50*

**Dan Maser**: I think the other thing with the interview flow, yeah, it, yep. They're all in the product delivery space, right?
*56:02*

**Gus Schissler**: I believe that's the case.
*56:13*

**Dan Maser**: And that is that middle layer, correct?
*56:17*

**Gus Schissler**: I believe so.
*56:23*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, I see. Product, product delivery, additional groups, yes, we will clean all this up. And then user requirement, who's that at? That's just, like, the documentation phase, like, that top layer.
*56:24*

**Gus Schissler**: I think so, because that's even, What was I looking at? I was looking at something that had…
*56:37*

**Dan Maser**: They couldn't Christmas.
*56:48*

**Gus Schissler**: that.
*56:49*

**Dan Maser**: Who creates those user requirements? They're, like, pre-canned, almost.
*56:51*

**Gus Schissler**: It's floating up here.
*56:56*

**Dan Maser**: Great.
*56:58*

**Gus Schissler**: in this PDF.
*56:59*

**Nathan Papes**: Meaning, like, maybe it's coming from…
*57:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Toyota Motor Company or something, actually. Is that… Yeah. Toyota Motor Company or Consumer Applic- or customer applications is…
*57:03*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*57:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, the people in charge of deciding what needs to happen.
*57:19*

**Dan Maser**: So then… so then my only question with that, the code getting released to the vehicle wouldn't be part of that user requirement side, either. That would… that would remain down in the… product, correct?
*57:24*

**Gus Schissler**: Maybe… I don't know. That's a good question to ask. Let's see… like, who… it might be, like, a who does this thing. Do you have a color for the stickies that.
*57:34*

**Dan Maser**: No, we can color code it. I… red was just my updating, but yeah, we can… red can mean color. We can beautifully… my thought was to beautify this.
*57:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*58:03*

**Dan Maser**: There's…
*58:04*

**Gus Schissler**: Is in charge of this.
*58:04*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, sorry, I interrupted you and got us off track.
*58:19*

**Gus Schissler**: You're good. I'm kind of almost viewing this like a mini workshop, almost.
*58:22*

**Dan Maser**: It feels like, I think you actually put it really well earlier, where, like, it feels like we're really completing kickoff through these. And the goal is to really create some artifacts from this. Okay.
*58:29*

**Gus Schissler**: A lot of this we can, like… Take care. because we're trying to move so quickly, and I doubt that we can get so many people in the room together all at once, it might be worth just… like… We'll show this same thing to Andrea and to Julia, but it'll look more fleshed out when we show it to Julia.
*59:11*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*59:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Same thing with, like, the stakeholder chart or ecosystem map, because… The thing that we're building, Dan, you and me, isn't anything… At this level, up here, like, all of these things?
*59:35*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*59:55*

**Gus Schissler**: It's this thing, in here.
*59:56*

**Dan Maser**: Right. All that we're building, right, is, like, exactly, like, something that monitors the changelog, or something that monitors changes and automatically adds it to the changelog. Is that… is that correct?
*59:57*

**Gus Schissler**: I bel… I hope so, and that's kind of, like, the goal of this thing.
*60:09*

**Dan Maser**: We can double… we can double check, but I think… That was my understanding as well. Okay. Well, no, I said that, obviously. Cool, well, we're aligned? Shit! Yeah. I feel great!
*60:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. Goal for this group of interviews is to have an accurate service blueprint for…
*60:24*

**Dan Maser**: So I think… do we… so then, I do think… are you calling that out in the questions of, we probably want a specific question? I mean, I think we're probably going to get to it. I just want to say this out loud, like, we need to make sure that the purple part gets acknowledged in question one, or if it should be in another area.
*60:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, it's in, so…
*60:57*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, that's… yeah, yeah, you're.
*60:59*

**Gus Schissler**: For example, is this big picture, then Q2… his… How does product delivery play a role? Throughout this process.
*61:01*

**Dan Maser**: And I'm talking about that after any change, that whole thing, how we have to remap that out. I mean, we will get to that… yeah, this. Like, we'll get to this in question one. Correct. No, we get to it in two. So question one is, is this right?
*61:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Is this horrible thing right?
*61:33*

**Dan Maser**: I thought question 2 was this, like, product lane, but I see what you're saying. Okay, question 2 is this right here.
*61:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Right. Specifically, like, what does… so we talked high level about the whole system, but what does product delivery actually do?
*61:40*

**Dan Maser**: Right. And so this is product delivery, which is after changes.
*61:50*

**Gus Schissler**: I assume, but that's where I mentioned before, like. Maybe these aren't stickies, maybe these are just, like, a full, like…
*61:56*

**Dan Maser**: Right. I think that's where I'm getting hung up, because, like, if… Like… If… do teams also do product delivery things in their own? Like, when it's down here, if things are changing, do the teams do it? Yes, okay, yep, that's…
*62:05*

**Gus Schissler**: That's what I mean. But I don't want to muddy the waters, I just want to ask, like, is this how things flow? The thing is, like, I… I think teams monitor their own requirements and whatnot.
*62:22*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*62:35*

**Gus Schissler**: But I don't know, like, like we heard on Monday, some of them are in JAMA, some of them are in GitHub, some of them are in Confluence, some are in Google Sheets.
*62:37*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*62:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, you know, in some extent, like, we don't care what they do, we just need to know where they're putting them.
*62:47*

**Dan Maser**: Exactly.
*62:55*

**Gus Schissler**: I think it's outside the realm of feasibility to ask them to change their process, or else that's… What they would invest in.
*62:56*

**Dan Maser**: No.
*63:04*

**Gus Schissler**: Asking us to build this thing.
*63:04*

**Dan Maser**: And I think, to your point, exactly, like, we don't care how they're changing it, but it's when they change it, who knows, and how does it get changed.
*63:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes. Yep. How do you know?
*63:17*

**Dan Maser**: So is it… how does product delivery play a role, or how does, like, change management play a role, or product delivery and change… Or product delivery is change management. I think that's what I'm getting caught up on, if that sounds like a ridiculous question.
*63:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, product delivery is the team that we're talking to, so it's like… Julia and Andrea are people that are performing these actions.
*63:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, I got it. We're good.
*64:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay, cool.
*64:03*

**Dan Maser**: Thank you for letting me ask all the crazy questions.
*64:05*

**Gus Schissler**: No worries. But that makes me wonder, like, is this enough for… I think it's enough for an hour, but is there more that we want to ask?
*64:08*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, that's why I was wondering if we… I'm wondering some of these other questions that are down here, if any of them feel relevant, I see your question about stakeholder chart and ecosystem map. I do think we could get more into that. Like, I do think… like, we have the question of, like, how many teams, like, number 2 down here, I'm realizing I'm looking at my version, like, how many teams, like, that does feel like, like, we could ask, especially, like, especially that first interview. It feels like… exactly. Yep.
*64:18*

**Gus Schissler**: What we could do is, take this as, like, a… what do we need to know in order to start building out a stakeholder map? Or an ecosystem about?
*64:55*

**Dan Maser**: There's, like…
*65:04*

**Gus Schissler**: To be essentially one and the same.
*65:05*

**Dan Maser**: I'm looking at some of these other ones.
*65:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, let's… let's take a stroll and cherry-pick. I'm gonna strike through this one, since it's something…
*65:15*

**Dan Maser**: We need to start striking through.
*65:23*

**Gus Schissler**: I always forget the markdown strikethrough. Is it? Is it Striggles?
*65:26*

**Nathan Papes**: It's a squig… yeah, it should be the squiggles one on each end, I thought.
*65:30*

**Dan Maser**: May, you're a champ for having no access to anything and dealing with all this.
*65:36*

**Gus Schissler**: And also.
*65:40*

**Nathan Papes**: I'm just trying to… I'm trying to absorb what, like, what they've thrown at you so far, and how you go about figuring this out.
*65:40*

**Dan Maser**: I'm also curious about timeline, because I know they want to move very fast, but I've already seen, like, similar to Ford, like. Like, oh, they don't have meetings on Friday, and we can't meet with Julia until Monday, and now Nate was pushed back until Monday. It'll be really interesting to see how this goes.
*65:48*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I mean…
*66:07*

**Nathan Papes**: No.
*66:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, we… I mean, we have, like. A little over 30 days to, like, really… Figure some stuff out, and maybe make a good first pass on something. From… just taking a second here before we dig into the other questions that might exist below, and I'll probably run around 4 today, but the… Like, of all the problems to solve. This is a pretty small problem, I think. Like, they're not asking us to, like, solve, like, vehicle triage data, like Matt Soto and Tahiri, or… okay, how do we integrate all these different test suites and simulations and outputs that we have, like Casey and Rebecca, like. From my perspective. It's, like, it's a small, encapsulated problem that they're trying to fix, and from a product perspective, that's really… I don't want to say it's simple.
*66:10*

**Dan Maser**: It's well-defined.
*67:07*

**Gus Schissler**: it is well-defined. So I'm… and that's where I'm trying to… Like, I don't wanna… I don't wanna run a full, like. kickoff… kickoff thing here, because I don't wanna… and I alluded this to Julie on Monday when we were talking, they've done a lot of work, and they're product people, so they know how to take a problem, how do we build a tiny experiment around the problem, and then… validate whether or not it's something they want to continue with. So they know how to do that, and I don't want to rehash those same things. What I want to show them is, like. We can learn really fast.
*67:08*

**Dan Maser**: Yum.
*67:45*

**Gus Schissler**: And then get on the same page really quickly, and then figure out, okay, now that we have the context, let's try to go solve this thing, so…
*67:46*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*67:54*

**Gus Schissler**: That's why, like, in my mind, a lot of the traditional user interviews and research stuff that we would do is kind of being abbreviated at this point, since they just have… So much context.
*67:55*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, no, similar.
*68:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. Cool, but I… I mean, I'm… I'm feeling good at this point. I'm not too worried.
*68:10*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I mean, I think the most overwhelming thing about this is just, it's just the most abstract and foreign… not even abstract, it's just a foreign environment, right?
*68:18*

**Gus Schissler**: And we're talking.
*68:25*

**Dan Maser**: We're talking about a very foreign autonomy codebase and process, and it's just getting familiar with that. Okay, sorry, so that said, to try and get you out the door at 4.
*68:26*

**Gus Schissler**: We can go a little bit over, too. I'm just taking a brief scroll through the Obsidian to see if there are any, like, relevant questions. Mmm, how often do releases happen? How about that?
*68:41*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, so if you scroll all the way down when I was asking it for… how… do we already have answers? We can get it. It…
*68:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Where the hell did that go? Oh, did it disappeared?
*69:03*

**Dan Maser**: No, no, no, no, I added new questions. If you look at… it added new stupid parts. Where is it? Did it… Get outta here.
*69:06*

**Gus Schissler**: questions…
*69:18*

**Dan Maser**: It might have. If you go… That's dumb, it deleted them. If you go to the other document. Discovery interview questions the first time around. It… It did say that it was addressed. It said… If you scroll to fully answered, it said, there… it's said daily.
*69:19*

**Gus Schissler**: Tag is cut from master each day, that tag goes through to nightly tests, an open-loop blog replay. Daily release build is produced. One daily release build per week is selected as the production release, and gets an extra 150 kilometers of testing. Oh, cool!
*69:47*

**Nathan Papes**: Interesting.
*70:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Answered synthesized from… That's synthesized from the.
*70:08*

**Dan Maser**: from the video, that Brian video.
*70:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*70:19*

**Dan Maser**: So, I think the way we ask that is… that's a clarification, but it's like, this is… this is correct, right? Like, this is happening daily. Are we correct on that, or some way of phrasing that?
*70:20*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm… I mean, I don't think it's… With how much stuff they're juggling, Yeah.
*70:32*

**Dan Maser**: True.
*70:38*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't know if it can happen daily.
*70:39*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, that's a good point.
*70:41*

**Gus Schissler**: So, it might be that, like, these, these tags.
*70:44*

**Dan Maser**: are too low in the V for them to worry about? Yeah.
*70:50*

**Gus Schissler**: Part of me wonders if this is, like… like, I don't know, if there's some other, like… release level that's getting cut. Not even, like, the weekly, but maybe… Like, what are they tracking all the requirements for? Like, what are they… what are they unifying all this stuff for? Kind of thing.
*70:55*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I'm wondering the best way to ask that. I mean, we might get that in the map, but… I'm trying to think of the section to ask that in, or how we ask it.
*71:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm… Let's do… let's just do this. Can you walk us through, oh, it fits in right here. A high level and then narrowing down. So, like, we'll talk about what role they play, How frequently? Is this… cycle occurring. Is this a week-to-week pattern?
*71:31*

**Dan Maser**: I like that.
*72:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Monthly? Up there? Something like that.
*72:08*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*72:13*

**Gus Schissler**: I didn't, realize that we had some of these fully answered things, but, for a bill to be cleared for vehicles… PR. Vehicle operations runs closed course. Results go through… Approved. field ops can load into vehicles. So this… is… Field Ops, to me, reads as…
*72:17*

**Dan Maser**: the drivers.
*72:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, the testing drivers, maybe?
*72:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, yeah, because that fits with my mental model, too, because remember, like, they have to manually load the data into the, like, the codebase into the vehicles, and that's what I confirmed with Muhammad, too. So they have to physically load it in.
*72:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep.
*73:06*

**Dan Maser**: I believe this is, like… so in order to be ready to release means, like, they are ready to put it into the vehicle.
*73:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*73:14*

**Dan Maser**: So… Yeah, keep going.
*73:15*

**Gus Schissler**: This is… and that's mostly because, Closed course is one thing, but to go through, like, some Python stuff, and some, an approval and then going into actual consumer vehicles seems a little short of a feedback loop. There might be some… there's, like, the actual real-world testing, I think, is what…
*73:17*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. If it was, like, Ford, though, the way they, like, it was, like, alpha tested, like, it was… if it was successful on the road, then… or on the closed course, then it went to the road. So, I believe that's… If the codebase, like, if that branch is successful, on the… In the closed course test script. Then they go… and it goes through the log review, and it's approved, then it goes to the road.
*73:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Whatever.
*74:11*

**Dan Maser**: That saying.
*74:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*74:15*

**Dan Maser**: We can confirm that, though.
*74:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm… Just reading through the rest of these.
*74:19*

**Dan Maser**: Yo. Okay, so yeah, this… these… these notes are also from the… the wrap-up summary as well.
*74:35*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, okay. Sweet.
*74:49*

**Dan Maser**: So, to answer your initial question, do we have any more? There is some more questions on the change tracking and change logs that we have.
*74:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Change tracking and change dogs, one second.
*75:06*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, you're good.
*75:10*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, okay. Oh yeah, what happens if a team changes the requirement after it's already been written?
*75:15*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*75:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Where does that go? That goes… Oh, yeah, when something changes, how do you know? bit of that.
*75:24*

**Dan Maser**: I think you have that, too. When a team makes a code change, is that what you're just saying?
*75:36*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*75:39*

**Dan Maser**: Where's a trace? Is that… We might… that little follow-up might actually be relevant, too. Is that captured in the PR JIRA or somewhere else, or not at all?
*75:40*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm… Just reading through these. Oh, that's a good… This is, like, a level of detail question that's actually not that bad.
*76:10*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*76:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Are we… are you, like, are you selecting everything?
*76:33*

**Dan Maser**: There's a question here, too. Is there currently a single person or role responsible for compiling a unified change log? Which, that would be a product… that would be a product delivery role, right? I mean, I think that's what we're getting already.
*76:44*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I think that's what we're getting at already. Q4 is… Product delivery process questions.
*77:01*

**Dan Maser**: Q3, you mean?
*77:19*

**Gus Schissler**: No, I'm kind of… I'm starting to think that, like. This is, like, a high-level question.
*77:24*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*77:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, okay, what does product delivery actually do? We're new here, explain it to us, and then… there's, Questions around their process, like, when we're saying, like, we're gathering requirements and putting them somewhere.
*77:31*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*77:47*

**Gus Schissler**: what… what's… what are those requirements putting in?
*77:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yup. We want to ask if it… oh, I was just saying there's two fours, no three, I'll move that, I'll change that. Do you want to ask if any of it… you're fine. Do you want to ask if any of it's automated versus manual?
*77:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Who… Yes, I do. What… No. How are… Responsibilities broken up? Is one person in charge of each release? Or a feature, maybe?
*78:08*

**Dan Maser**: I do feel good. I feel like we're winding up… we're gonna be automating some poor person, maybe Andrea… Andrea, is literally just going through, like, Git and all these different places, and then manually putting in JAMA.
*78:34*

**Gus Schissler**: I think it's a whole… I think it's their whole… Team.
*78:45*

**Dan Maser**: is they literally just browse through, oh, I'm looking at perception, they do this in a GitHub repo, I'll go search through the GitHub repo.
*78:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, weird.
*78:55*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, yep.
*78:57*

**Gus Schissler**: You asked me, oh, yeah, what…
*78:59*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*79:02*

**Gus Schissler**: anything is automated right now? Nope.
*79:03*

**Dan Maser**: Do we ask how they know to change things? I think we do. Yeah, we already have this. We have, how frequently is it occurring? Blah blah blah. Because I think you're right. I wouldn't be surprised if it's, like, someone writes in Slack, like, we had to update something, or they just have to manually check.
*79:08*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*79:38*

**Dan Maser**: It's… it's 4 o'clock, do you want to send this over?
*79:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I'm thinking we can probably pop it into a Google Doc.
*79:46*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*79:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Does they seem to use Google?
*79:51*

**Dan Maser**: I'm also gonna rename this file…
*79:58*

**Gus Schissler**: The goal for these interviews is to shortcut a lot of the activities we'd normally do during a formal workshop kickoff. As you… Folks have a lot of… Established context already. R.A. product org… And have a lot of established context already. So we really… Just need to get caught up to speed. First… Goal… is to have a… ASIC… Service Blueprint. of what… The problem space is, and what we need… we are building to fix. Pain point. Cool. So all these questions are adding up to… Like, a basic service blueprint.
*80:26*

**Dan Maser**: Or jump at, like, what the problem space is while we're building the thing. A basic service blueprint slash user journey… it's not user, but yeah. Yep.
*82:11*

**Gus Schissler**: What exists. Day in terms of process.
*82:33*

**Dan Maser**: Right. The only thing that I'm thinking of, too, and I don't think it's worth following right now, but, like, we will at some point need to figure out, like, which teams, how do… like, what is their process, and where do they contribute it, and we'll need to figure out where that is so that we can set it up, but I don't think that's worth our time right now.
*82:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, and it might even be that they have a team in mind already.
*83:03*

**Dan Maser**: Yep.
*83:08*

**Gus Schissler**: Because they want us to start with one.
*83:09*

**Dan Maser**: That's actually a really good question. Did… that might be a Julia question.
*83:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, let's…
*83:17*

**Dan Maser**: I'm adding that right down here at the bottom, it'll update. Did you have a team in mind for… the first… Pilot, which, and why. It'll load.
*83:19*

**Gus Schissler**: -Oh.
*83:55*

**Dan Maser**: coded it. What's wrong?
*83:57*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't think co-editing is gonna work.
*84:00*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh, what?
*84:04*

**Dan Maser**: What happened?
*84:05*

**Nathan Papes**: is overrid.
*84:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I was making changes, and I think I either overwrote you, or you overwrote.
*84:08*

**Dan Maser**: Interesting, because mine's updated. Oh, yup, yup, you're totally right. Okay, this is not Notion. We'll be smart about this.
*84:12*

**Nathan Papes**: That's funny, I saw that happen, and it's funny how one… like, yeah.
*84:18*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. We have a mirror with basic understand.
*84:23*

**Nathan Papes**: I'm gonna use a bowel break, guys.
*84:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, cool.
*84:31*

**Nathan Papes**: Right.
*84:32*

**Dan Maser**: See you later!
*84:33*

**Gus Schissler**: our understanding of the V. model. Cool. Walk through it together, big picture flow from user requirements to development teams, back, cover what's missing, what do we have wrong? Cool.
*84:56*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, you have to add that bit, yep.
*85:34*

**Gus Schissler**: For Julia, did you have a… oh, a team in mind to start with?
*85:37*

**Dan Maser**: Yep. And I had… yup, yup, that's perfect.
*85:46*

**Gus Schissler**: I can't believe there's no, like… service or something somewhere for, like, live editing Markdown files with collaborators.
*85:52*

**Dan Maser**: I'm sure there is, and…
*86:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Because that… what we need… because the… the interesting point is that we need… like, the files exposed locally so we can use them with… AI.
*86:06*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*86:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, getting Claude Cowork or something. But then… They need to be, like, constantly updated with what's on someone else's.
*86:16*

**Dan Maser**: Like, HackMD has something. Yeah. I don't know. You get out of here. This looks good. Oh yeah, you send that. I also accidentally deleted the partial questions, by accident, so I was going to… probably, unless you disagree, like, have one of these documents be, like, the scrappier one with the, like. Like, we can have one with actual questions on them, and the other one with, like, the partially answered, and things like the big… all the questions.
*86:29*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean, my gut says that all of that stuff should just be in a single document.
*87:00*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, and then just have it below the fold? That sounds good to me.
*87:04*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. And even… even then, it's like, we should have… instead of having, like, a… like, here are the questions, and then here are the partial answers and the actual answers, I think we should just have the answers right next to all the questions. And it's just gonna be, like, our… I've done this on projects before, where it's just, like, a running question log. Like, when we've had questions in the past, here are the answers to what those questions are.
*87:07*

**Dan Maser**: Well, and we can, like, going back to the original intent, we can try and turn these into assumptions, too, and play with it there, but yeah. Nate, it got real weird, you know how you have, like, the auto-zoom in on your camera? who had, like, weird 90s music video, like, Beastie Boys-type videos when you were walking into the frame, because it was, like.
*87:33*

**Nathan Papes**: It's like, oh…
*87:51*

**Dan Maser**: A real dramatic pan-in, yeah, it was weird. It felt… yeah.
*87:52*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*87:56*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No walk, yeah, it feels real, like…
*87:57*

**Nathan Papes**: That's crazy.
*88:02*

**Dan Maser**: I know as a feature.
*88:04*

**Nathan Papes**: Is that Zoom? Is that a Zoom update, or what?
*88:06*

**Dan Maser**: No, no, no, it's a, it's an Apple feature. I turn mine off, usually. It is, center stage. Here, I can turn mine on, and it does the same thing.
*88:08*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, I don't… I don't know if I like that.
*88:19*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, like… It follows you… The camera follows you, so you… Get more zoomed in.
*88:22*

**Nathan Papes**: I guess if you're, like, whiteboarding or something, or giving, like… I don't know, like, when that would be useful for, like, a face-to-face thing.
*88:32*

**Dan Maser**: It gets closer to your… it gets closer. The problem is, is if you're fidgety like I am, it's just your screen's constantly moving.
*88:38*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, yeah.
*88:47*

**Dan Maser**: So I couldn't.
*88:49*

**Gus Schissler**: I've sworn, Google Docs had, like, a paste from Markdown.
*88:50*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, it does. Which computer you're using, you have to enable it.
*88:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Where?
*88:57*

**Dan Maser**: Are you using the new computer? try file. There, go to…
*88:58*

**Nathan Papes**: Insert would be an insert, or format.
*89:10*

**Dan Maser**: It's a setting. It's a settings thing here. How to add export to Markdown on Google.
*89:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Cools, preferences, enable Markdown.
*89:21*

**Nathan Papes**: There you go.
*89:24*

**Dan Maser**: Gus, you win the MVP award, by the way, for realizing that the internal tool is what we want to really power that up. That really should have been told to us.
*89:25*

**Gus Schissler**: Cha.
*89:33*

**Dan Maser**: Boom.
*89:35*

**Nathan Papes**: The only setting not checked. Taurus.
*89:36*

**Dan Maser**: It's really… I don't know why it's not…
*89:39*

**Gus Schissler**: What the hell? It is a…
*89:41*

**Dan Maser**: Sorry, so what that setting does is it… it exports it to Markdown, but I don't know how to… No, I pasted from Markdown, and it got some of these things.
*89:43*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't know why it didn't, there we go. Boop-a-doop. Wait, no. There we go. Cool.
*89:54*

**Dan Maser**: Perfect. Okay.
*90:05*

**Gus Schissler**: It's 2…
*90:11*

**Dan Maser**: Perfect. Yep, that looks good.
*90:16*

**Gus Schissler**: We need a name for this project.
*90:26*

**Dan Maser**: Right. Did you like my half-assed one? .
*90:28*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm gonna call it item 10.
*90:33*

**Dan Maser**: I like it.
*90:35*

**Gus Schissler**: Because that's what.
*90:37*

**Dan Maser**: I'll rename ours. I'll rename our Slack channel while we're at it.
*90:40*

**Gus Schissler**: Did they… oh, did they make us a Slack channel? Like, I don'.
*90:44*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh, it's, what'd you do? Woven JAMA architecture team?
*90:47*

**Dan Maser**: Just woven item 10. I like it. That feels really… significant. We've only scheduled Andrea, right?
*90:53*

**Gus Schissler**: I scheduled, Julia on Monday.
*91:17*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, sorry. What I meant by that was, I know, I know she's at, like, 1 or something. We have 2 others, correct?
*91:19*

**Gus Schissler**: I wanna at least talk to… .
*91:27*

**Dan Maser**: Andrea first.
*91:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, I made that a viewer editor.
*91:37*

**Dan Maser**: Perfect.
*91:42*

**Gus Schissler**: too. Done. Easy peasy.
*91:42*

**Nathan Papes**: You're saying.
*91:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Do you want to talk to Andrea before you schedule the other two? I think so, it's like, what, what amount of…
*91:49*

**Dan Maser**: Changes do we make per person?
*91:57*

**Gus Schissler**: Either that, or, like, what do we need to know kind of thing? Usually, like, after the first interview, we're much more aware of, like, oh, we're completely off the mark in some area, or we know everything that we need in one, so… Totally.
*92:00*

**Dan Maser**: That's where Friday kind of messes us up, but I agree, I think it's fine if we… yeah, I think we're good.
*92:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*92:21*

**Dan Maser**: Cool. Alright, you get out of here.
*92:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. I don't know if… I guess, like, before I leave, so we've got the questions… We've got the Miro.
*92:25*

**Dan Maser**: I will make it a little bit easier to read, but I think it's in a pretty good spot.
*92:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool, cool. Yeah, then I think we're good. Who wants to lead tomorrow?
*92:41*

**Dan Maser**: We can figure that… oh, oh, oh, we can figure that out. I mean, I don't really care. I also don't know… how interactive it… like, it's gonna be interesting because it's kind of like putting something together. So… I don't, like, where, like, a normal interview where we're doing, like, you know… like, I think it's gonna be a little bit on the fly of, like, I'm not totally sure what the cadence is gonna be like, to your point, Gus. So, if you want to take a crack at it, or if we want to split it up, like, two and two… I think, like, the first question's kind of a monster in and of itself. It's kind of being, like… I think the answer is, like, one of us… I think the bigger thing is, like, one of us probably makes sense to kind of take point on asking questions, and the other one be, like, updating Miro while she talks, is probably the biggest thing. And then besides that, I think questions 2, 3, and 4 are gonna be significantly easier. With question 4, we might also want some, like, mural participation.
*92:51*

**Gus Schissler**: within…
*93:56*

**Dan Maser**: That's true, because question two is also going to be adjusting. So I'd say, why don't, for tomorrow, why don't you take a crack at asking them, and then I can be updating the Miro while we talk, and let's see how that goes. And then I think for the other three, hopefully it's gonna be a little bit less, like, adjusting things and more, like, validating things and asking follow-up questions.
*93:56*

**Gus Schissler**: Right.
*94:17*

**Dan Maser**: Kind of game plan for.
*94:18*

**Gus Schissler**: That makes sense to me.
*94:19*

**Dan Maser**: Sweet, that sounds good.
*94:21*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. Alrighty, folks. And… no, oh, last thing I was gonna say was, it might make the most sense for us to, like, each log into the meeting from our laptops, and just use, like, a single audio, since Andrea's gonna be remote, too. So, like, all of our faces on separate screens instead of… It's just been a nice thing for folks before.
*94:23*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. I also agree that, like, in a meeting room, it's kind of harder, especially if you're asking questions from multiple places.
*94:54*

**Nathan Papes**: Yep.
*95:00*

**Dan Maser**: The only other question…
*95:01*

**Gus Schissler**: you…
*95:02*

**Dan Maser**: If we wanted to, we could always just use separate.
*95:03*

**Gus Schissler**: Small rooms, too.
*95:05*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, the only other question… yeah, I think that makes sense. My only other question is, what sh… did you set it up? Is it a Zoom meeting? I feel like I'd prefer Zoom because… okay, sweet, you're already… you're already there. we haven't taken a Google… we haven't… we haven't taken one of their Google meeting hangouts yet and recorded Still. Sweet, you're already on it. Cool. I'm also decently flexible in the morning, so if something comes up, just throw it at me.
*95:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I wonder if Andre will have any questions. I know she's looking at that questions doc right now, so…
*95:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yup, we'll see. Alright, sweet. I will go ahead, I'm gonna polish up that, that document while we wait, and I'll also polish up the miro, but I'll… yeah, so… Cool. Sweet, man.
*95:38*

**Gus Schissler**: Okie dokie.
*95:50*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*95:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Thanks, folks. Talk to you soon.
*95:53*
