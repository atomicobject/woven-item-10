**Gus Schissler**: Whew! That was a lot.
*00:12*

**Dan Maser**: I've gotta figure this out. I've got 2… I've got 2 laptops and 3 screens right now, so… Nice. Did you… when you said… because I was also not sure, so I was, like, Mac whispering on my other screen, but did you get, like, the Google Gemini recording of it, or was it similar?
*00:13*

**Gus Schissler**: star.
*00:29*

**Dan Maser**: I realized, like, 5 minutes later that someone had pressed recording through…
*00:29*

**Gus Schissler**: I think they're all default.
*00:34*

**Dan Maser**: Great, because I was going to say we could also just poke them on Slack. For the actual recording, because it might actually have It might be even better.
*00:36*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm on my… .
*00:45*

**Dan Maser**: I also need to… just FYI, I need to run at, like, 12.45, because I have to run to the dentist, but…
*00:55*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh, no. Yeah, no, I don't think there's a ton to talk about, I was just…
*01:00*

**Dan Maser**: I know.
*01:04*

**Gus Schissler**: decent code.
*01:05*

**Dan Maser**: I always appreciate a sync-up post-meeting like that, especially.
*01:06*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm surprised, actually, that there's not a transcript automatically linked.
*01:10*

**Dan Maser**: Boom.
*01:15*

**Gus Schissler**: the Google Calendar.
*01:16*

**Dan Maser**: So, yeah, cause you… did you… so when you said recording, you were looking, like, through the Google. Like, through the media.
*01:19*

**Gus Schissler**: I… no, I had Mac Whisper running.
*01:26*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, I had Mac Whisper running, too. I'm just wondering if there's an easy way that we can, like, see the… I'll just poke them right now and ask it if that's okay.
*01:28*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool. Yeah, I will… if you're cool with it, I will just find time… With those 3 folks, with you and me.
*01:37*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*01:48*

**Gus Schissler**: And then… .
*01:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, my… I think my only… not even hesitation, because I really liked what you said there, my only hesitation is, like. Planning it out long enough that we have enough of a runway to figure out a little bit more of what the fuck we need to, like, ask.
*01:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Right, oh yeah, that was gonna be… that was gonna be exactly what I bring up next, is like, when the fuck do you and I talk about what we need to…
*02:05*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I'm pretty flexible, over these next few days. Also, full side note, Brian was like, yeah, I have new thoughts, when would you want to meet to talk about that? And he can talk, like, today at… like, he said today anytime after 2, or if we want to, we can talk to him tomorrow in person. There's a lot to unpack here, so… Yes. That aside, but yeah.
*02:12*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm freeing up my…
*02:39*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I also… What was the… what was the other… not Julia, what's the other woman's name? I totally forgot.
*02:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Andrea?
*02:45*

**Dan Maser**: Andre, yes, I'm just gonna make a group chat.
*02:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Weird.
*02:51*

**Dan Maser**: Hello.
*02:52*

**Gus Schissler**: Nice. But yeah, like, don't need to cover this now, we can probably cover it once you get back from the dentist, but I was just thinking, There's probably some work we can do to, like, ingest or internalize all of the… bits and pieces of information that we got, just got from Julia.
*03:12*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. I also… did you see my message about that video, that onboarding video? I just started watching it. Did you watch that one?
*03:33*

**Gus Schissler**: Let me see… Is this a… is this in the… Toyota space, or in the…
*03:43*

**Dan Maser**: in the… it was… it was on the onboarding document that we got from Muhammad, but basically, it was just helpful because it was explaining their code releases, and it was… it was just giving good context, so…
*03:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*04:07*

**Dan Maser**: My frustration was, like, it wasn't transcribed. I couldn't find… I was gonna poke around more, so I was, like, while I was listening to it, I had Mac Whisper going, just to, like… because that would also be really helpful, just to have in the knowledge base, because it was a lot of cadence shit, and, like… Yeah. But anyways, sorry.
*04:08*

**Gus Schissler**: That's super valuable. No, I was just asking, because I opened it up on my work computer, and it asked if I wanted to request access. Open it up on mine. woven laptop. Yes.
*04:26*

**Dan Maser**: When you say… when you say work computer, which I totally get, but when you say work computer.
*04:39*

**Gus Schissler**: It's… I mean, you're… you have 3 work… like…
*04:43*

**Dan Maser**: I get it. I get it.
*04:46*

**Gus Schissler**: I… at least my, like, at least my two laptops are the same color, or different colors, so I got that going for me. Mine are different colors, too. The Toyota one's really big. Huge. Yeah. Anyway.
*04:49*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*05:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay, yes.
*05:03*

**Dan Maser**: You asked some really great clarifying questions. Thank you so much for bringing those up as a… Gate, if you will.
*05:05*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, please don't, I… That's just… part of how I work… like, we haven't worked together before, don't… I have gotten the feedback in the past that I can, commandeer conversations a lot, so… I try to keep in mind if anybody looks like they're going to say anything, like.
*05:13*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*05:38*

**Gus Schissler**: we were going to ask a question at one point, and I wanted to make sure we got to you, but feel free to interrupt me at any point.
*05:39*

**Dan Maser**: No, nope, I said that very genuinely, because I feel like your questions very much help me, and I'm also… you know my personality well enough, like, if I'm gonna say something, I will say something. Do not… I get that, especially for, like, quieter people, but I'm not a quiet person, so… Sweet. No, genuinely, because yes, it… a lot of this was like, man, what the fuck am I looking at? Yeah. So… Yes.
*05:45*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. I think the… what I'm getting is… I've gotten some initial vibes that things… Sound like they're… Probably manageable. we'll be able to solve this somehow, someway. But this is… I think we're really just trying to show… with whatever length of engagement we actually have with them right now, that we're, like, really collaborative, intelligent people, it doesn't really matter what the outcome looks like at this point, so…
*06:11*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*06:46*

**Gus Schissler**: That's where I'm, like, just… Let's just figure out the best way to collaborate with them, and if we figure out how to solve their problem along the way, then that will be fantastic.
*06:47*

**Dan Maser**: And I think, to be… to elaborate on that, I think going back to our… because I 100% agree. with your, like, thought… and our thoughts, we worked on it together, of, like, doing discovery interviews makes a ton of sense. For me, I'm like, I want to make sure I have a good enough… own… like, the way I think is, like, mental model, and, like, I want to make sure I have a good enough mental model going into it, so I'm… we're asking the right questions, and, like you're saying, like. they know that we're asking the right questions, and they're not like, what the fuck are you guys doing? So that's my biggest thought, is like, okay, how can we at least have… The wherewithal to know what to ask beforehand.
*07:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep. I will… I'm gonna see how far I can get. I need to take the dogs on a walk, but, I'll see how far I can get this afternoon on, like, consolidating those different pieces into the knowledge base, because it could be that. Wednesday or Thursday is when we end up talking with,
*07:40*

**Dan Maser**: I think, yeah.
*08:02*

**Gus Schissler**: I think talking with Julia first will be fantastic, and then talking with the other folks and establishing some more context will be helpful, too.
*08:03*

**Dan Maser**: The other question, I don't know if it matters, but we… if we want, like, it sounds like… Andrea, Andrea, and… If we want to do in-person, we can. I don't… for… two of them are Ann Arbor, I don't know if it matters that much.
*08:12*

**Gus Schissler**: radiance's sake, I'd say, trying to wrangle that? Probably not.
*08:31*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I think you're right. Especially because our core, like, if… If, if, What's Your Face was in Ann Arbor, I'd say maybe, but yeah, yeah, I agree. Like, if they were all in Ann Arbor, then we would just do…
*08:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay. Like, we would do an in-person, 3-hour-long kickoff and just really hit the ground running, but, That's a good point, like, it might be useful for you and I to look at Like, the past… like, the workshop templates that Brian's worked on, I've worked on, Ian's worked on. I think you've done some kickoffs, too. I've done… I've done a kickoff, yup. Are there any of those resources that might be helpful for us to work through with them, like an ecosystem map? or, like, something that visualizes the learning that we're about to do.
*08:50*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*09:33*

**Gus Schissler**: Doing it asynchronously.
*09:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, no, and I actually… in that… in that working with Wovee, I was trying to get… and it made some mermaid diagrams for me, because it's like, I was… like, you saw the presentation, because I was getting, like… the feedback loop's the same, but the system, like, I was really, like, having… I had to, like… honestly, like, really had to brush up on, like, okay, no, but we are working on the gate system, like, it's, like, the gatekeeping of, like. how these things are integrated together and making sure that these are integrated well is really more the problem that we are on, as I understand it now.
*09:35*

**Gus Schissler**: Gotcha.
*10:06*

**Dan Maser**: And so… Yeah, to your point… And you gotta go to the dentist. Yes, thank you. Yes, I will go. Yeah, we'll keep talking.
*10:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I'll do some HackerCat stuff on a computer, and then we can chat this afternoon.
*10:15*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, it sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, totally. Practicing, Dan. Yep, yep.
*10:20*
