**Dan** *00:01*
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, so we don't know what the... Yeah, the JAMA seems like their existing requirements. Yeah, okay. So...

**Nate** *00:22*
Well, so we're more of, like, a validation. We're kind of more... We're also helping out with, like, information. Organizational type—

**Dan** *00:32*
Word. Yes.

**Nate** *00:33*
They've already developed the AI for the car. Yeah, we have—

**Dan** *03:20*
I ran through. I ran through my slideshow. I'm recording this. You bet to dunk in donuts. Yeah, dude. This is the best. He comes in with donuts. You made my whole day. Nate's my new favorite. Anyways, I was going through, I started going through, I don't even know what this is. Is it the doc that you're leaving this? Well, that's what I started to go through. I started to go through that. Where was the other document? I started with the document that we all had for our kickoff that wasn't really our kickoff, I don't know how relevant that one is.

**Gus** *04:05*
Oh, like the big long list of...

**Dan** *04:07*
Yeah.

**Gus** *04:08*
That was a weird duck.

**Dan** *04:10*
Is it relevant for us?

**Gus** *04:13*
No, because Julia's content...

**Dan** *04:16*
Is better?

**Gus** *04:18*
Yeah, it expands on that.

**Dan** *04:20*
Because I started by...

**Gus** *04:23*
Is this onboarding checklist for Atomic Object 1, or is it...

**Dan** *04:26*
No, it's the Julia one.

**Gus** *04:29*
Can we title the Julia one Julia 1? Or is their name?

**Dan** *04:33*
I'm sorry. Yes, Atomic Object Project Details. Details for item 10.

**Gus** *04:38*
Ah, yes. I have that one.

**Dan** *04:40*
So I showed this. I was showing this, the first thing, and then we switched over slightly.

**Gus** *04:46*
Oh, okay.

**Nate** *04:53*
I love the onboarding checklist that we have. It's just like, great idea. It's not filled out at all. Or the one that— I don't know if we made it. Oh yeah. Epic 2, oh this is the stuff that she'll probably go over with us tomorrow. So that and that being, are we driving there or that's over Zoom? That's over Zoom. Or Google Meet. Google Meet. And then if you get the link, you're gonna email me or put me on the calendar. Okay.

**Dan** *05:31*
Uh it's just—

**Gus** *05:41*
Nate how do you spell your last name? P-A-P-E-S?

**Dan** *05:49*
Oh man I was mispronouncing your name the whole time. I'm so sorry.

**Nate** *05:53*
I don't know. It's a root. It's Papes. Papis.

**Dan** *05:57*
I mean, I will say Nate Papes sounds pretty cool.

**Nate** *06:00*
Yeah, that's what everybody...

**Dan** *06:02*
So it's... Papis?

**Nate** *06:05*
Yeah. Like, hey, this. This.

**Dan** *06:08*
All right. I just sent you to this, too, because this is, like, the sync meeting with sales. So I gave them a broad brush overview of, like, how they're doing testing. And then we started...

**Gus** *06:23*
Like the actual driving testing, right?

**Dan** *06:27*
Yeah.

**Gus** *06:27*
Not the baseline data.

**Dan** *06:29*
No, no, no, not with this. I started, we did look through, I was starting to go through like WoV because we had some questions on like the SBRD. So we started to go through that, which— have you looked through that at all? Like the scenario-based requirements development? Because that's kind of what we're working on.

**Nate** *06:48*
Okay.

**Gus** *06:54*
Oh so like not hitting dogs and cats? Yes, so we're working on like— example, like, before it was great.

**Dan** *07:01*
Yes so like the cat— like we're working on the report card I believe. Um, okay, is— I think how we do it but then we started kind of looking through here which is Julia's work. Yes, that's— I think I'm—

**Gus** *07:17*
In the same place. Systems engineering tools support. So there are so many things that, as this is written, I want to just pick it apart.

**Dan** *07:32*
Right. Do you want to make a copy and we can put some comments on it? That might be genuinely helpful. Yeah, let's do it. Okay.

**Gus** *07:43*
I mean, well, she gave us edit access.

**Dan** *07:45*
I know, I just don't know how many of those questions, comments that we want her to see.

**Nate** *07:48*
I'll just cop, look it in, and then, yeah. I'm changing it. Is that it for her? Let's see what she looks like. But, yeah, I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but, like, what they're— it's a lot of, like, words, I guess.

**Dan** *08:04*
I still, that's where I saw— I'm still trying to grapple with the baseline of, like, so there's all these code bases. It's, like, right? Like, yes. Well, like, teams. So, yeah, all these teams. There's all these teams, these are little people, and they're all developing code. That's my code base. And then they have to integrate their codes into one singular point, right?

**Gus** *08:34*
Are you recording this right now?

**Dan** *08:36*
Yep. Hello. It's chilly, right? I'm on that quest work. Yeah, yeah. Cool. And so then it has to turn into a one, and that's what gets ingested into the car. But I believe where we're working on is like, what are the gates that they have to pass in order to create, like, in order to include it in this?

**Gus** *08:57*
That's why we no longer have a chart. Sorry. I think so. I don't know if it's just the gates or if it's just getting it there.

**Dan** *09:11*
So let's look into that because that's a really good question. Sorry, because that's where I'm starting. It's like my mental model is like— I have no mental model. And that looks like a stethoscope. Okay. Oh, it does. Yeah. So that's what I was trying to like— And I don't know how helpful this was because I was literally like querying like based on this, like what do you even think? And that's where it was like— because I know it's constructing the proofs and controls that the integrated system is correct and not constructing the integrated system itself. Sorry, yes, so I can just kind of go through what I said here. So let me just— because this is what I was doing on the plane and I'm sorry if this is like redundant but I was like— fuck, no no this was— that— no I'll set the context. Oh that's— oh it was at 10:10 a.m. Okay so it wasn't that early but yeah. Okay so I was like oh my gosh okay this is too much work so yeah. Um so okay so I was like typical— what's the process that software's updated, and so it sent me this like step-by-step process and I think we have a video and I have the— and now this is not Woven's process because it didn't specifically know but I bet we have a video of the process too. That's what I also documented, I haven't like looked at it yet but I recorded it. So after it sent me the whole process I said okay I sent the brief and that's the thing that Julia shared with us. So then I said okay based on that what did I say— I said um I'm gonna share the brief, I'd love you to read through, tell me what context would be most important for me to have. Um okay so— okay so based on this, this is what it started saying is— now I didn't show any of the— the Julia stuff, so that might be better to see what it says. But like what sign off actually means and what at Woven ADAS— and I think what sign off is to validate and sign off releases. I think that's like, is that, Nate, is that fair? Like a sign off meaning like, we're good and so now it's in here?

**Nate** *11:35*
Yeah, I mean, it could be a gate just to say like, it passed that test. To me, I doubt that we'd have code changes. And we'll have to think about this. Because we didn't build a thing that like, the software system that actually drives the car. So they probably have software updates to the vehicle. Sorry. Software updates to the vehicle probably, this part of Japan can probably do it over there. And then the states, they probably just want, the state, like the CFO of the states, we have to go by our regulations. So, and also like have a utility full heavy, sure, and all that kind of crap. So I'm guessing they want to like automate like to stop driving and stuff in a simulation maybe or like without a physical person driving a car.

**Gus** *12:32*
So there's— I think there is tooling for that already. So there's both simulation work and both of it— so like a lot of the outliers— so I think what I've realized the difference in how we're thinking is like, are we helping them do these gates here through maybe there's like a simulation test and then a real world vehicle test or something from this. Yeah, sorry. Or does the check happen before the release is pushed to cars? So this is cars here, just to say this is the integrated copy. So I think the thing that we're solving is that they don't have this list. Yes, exactly. So we're not helping them with each of these things up here from all of these different teams. We're helping them create this list so they might want to say yes to or no to it.

**Dan** *13:28*
Because my only question is, this is already being populated in one way. No. Well, manually, yes. Yes, yeah, yeah.

**Gus** *13:36*
So you're saying it's not being automated. Correct. I was going to say, yeah. Yeah, which is what we look at.

**Dan** *13:43*
Because, yeah, because this is where, really quickly, this is where I was getting confused. Because I was like, let me just run to it. So, yeah, this is the integration. What I was trying to say is like this integration gate is the first gate.

**Gus** *14:00*
Is this— well, this language, or is this?

**Dan** *14:05*
This, no, we need to— this is— this was the Toyota's language. But yeah, I don't know how much this is canon.

**Gus** *14:13*
Okay.

**Dan** *14:14*
It's a great question.

**Gus** *14:15*
Yeah.

**Dan** *14:19*
But I asked the gates. So there's the integration gate, the V&V gate, the safety gate, and the program gate. Does this make sense?

**Gus** *14:29*
We don't know if any of these things actually exist.

**Dan** *14:31*
No, no. And that's where...

**Gus** *14:33*
So you don't want to build anything off of it.

**Dan** *14:35*
No. Yeah. Well, we know... Here we go. Because, yeah, this is... So this is the pipeline. Sorry. This is what I was looking for. Builds happen in silos, integration produces a combined thing— that's what I was trying to draw— and then there's validation which includes test driving. Yes.

**Gus** *15:03*
So there's— what, assuming any of this is correct—

**Dan** *15:09*
And that's what I took a map.

**Gus** *15:12*
This is what Casey and Rebecca were working on.

**Dan** *15:14*
Right, exactly. I know we're not doing that.

**Gus** *15:18*
Right on. And then this is what a part of what Matt Soto and Deferi are working on is like triaging. That's why their work stream is called triage. What we're working on is here if you scroll down. Hold on. Yeah. If things are ready to go or not. Yes, because that's what— okay. Go on. And then what you're working on is based on all of these changes that are happening everywhere, give someone an architecture diagram that updates automatically based on what's changing. Wait, so say what we're doing again? So you and I, and this is leaning heavily on Julia's doc, is like, all of those different teams either have actual pull requests, documents on Git, Google Docs, JAMA requirements, Confluence docs, like all of those different things are saying like— we'll call— I don't know the actual names of the departments— but Vision or Vision Breaking— Vision's release going into this like combined release has their own like changelog or things that they worked on that is going in the code that is going along with this release that's written in a markdown file in GitHub. I don't know if that's actually the case, but it's stored— some product manager somewhere wrote down what was in their release somewhere because that's what they've always done. Right. And they have their own process of managing what's in a release. Well, so that would apply that by six or five. Right. All these different product managers working with their teams to build their own stuff. So essentially you have however many teams they have, writing their own documentation around what's changed in each of their houses— and right now Julia and her team, like the product delivery board, is take— like cherry-picking the important things out of all of those documents and all of those changes, right, in order to build the full changelog of what that— like, integrated— if we're calling it an integrated release. So that's what I was—

**Dan** *17:39*
I was really un-eloquently trying to say earlier. Let's take this broken down. I know they have to make— let's say this is team A and team B, perception and vision. I don't get this in fun. Perception and braking. So what I was struggling with is they merge the code, right? Code gets merged, but I'm confused at like, so they need to merge the code and the changelog? I was confused because I know we're here, but why is the changelog— Does that make sense what I'm stumbling over?

**Gus** *18:10*
So my assumption is they have infrastructure that separates releases from an individual team's tech or Git. Braking might be releasing every week, but it doesn't mean that their releases are going out to cars every week. They could be cutting releases into a lower environment. I don't— this is where I don't know anything about, right, how they work. But say they're in a lower environment and to get to maybe QA— for them to do real vehicle testing, all of those different requirements have to come back. So this is say they're working— and this is code in like their dev environment— and they have a changelog in their dev environment. But you have to multiply this by like five or 20 teams or however many teams are managing their own code. But we want one like QA and as part of that QA a set of changes, right. And that— I guess I'm getting— is this whole—

**Dan** *19:20*
Thing being manually— we don't know— but is the whole thing being manually done, or this is being—

**Gus** *19:25*
Automatically done and this is being done? I assume this is being automatically done because you just have either GitHub or— I assume that's what JAMA does. There's a whole team doing this, right? And this is what— if we can automate this, that's what massively improves the time, correct? Because then, yeah. So this is like, here's what's actually changing. And then maybe alongside this for this whole QA section is like a "here's an architecture diagram." So you have a bird's eye view of everything that's changing from all these different teams. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool.

**Dan** *20:01*
This is making more sense now. And so, what we have a video for, and I can even have it summarized today, is we have a video, I believe, of Brian describing— it's the push, it is the push process. So I'm assuming he might explain how they do it, but now that I'm saying it, I don't know how helpful that video is for us because—

**Gus** *20:25*
Well it depends on if he's describing the process that he used to get to dev, or if they used to get to this kind of like centrally integrated environment. I'll probably look at it. Yeah, and this is where like yeah I don't want to— I don't—

**Dan** *20:40*
And this is where I don't want to use— so much, too much— on Wovie because I don't know. Part of the reason, only reason I did this because Muhammad was like "oh just like talk to the AI and it'll know." But I specifically asked process of—

**Gus** *21:03*
Merging code from— actually I would start this in a new chat. Yep yep yep, yeah yeah.

**Dan** *21:23*
Of merging.

**Gus** *21:26*
How about "gathering code from the different teams into a single release" or something like that?

**Nate** *21:35*
Is that what you were going to say? It's like just sort of change management process. Use like biz— like not even technical terms. The code is, I don't know what you'd want to call it. What's the sort of change management process of some business lingo?

**Dan** *21:53*
Yeah. See what... Yeah.

**Nate** *22:02*
So what do we have? Commentary framework. No. So nothing.

**Dan** *22:15*
So it doesn't look like much. No, okay cool. All right, well then let's stop messing— where is— I mean if you um—

**Gus** *22:23*
You asked that same question in your previous chat I think it would give you something. Yeah.

**Dan** *22:28*
Well that's— and I think it was just pulling it off of this, which is frustrating. Okay all right.

**Gus** *22:34*
Well that's good to know. So we're starting to build some of the questions that we need to ask—

**Dan** *22:40*
Right.

**Gus** *22:42*
Andrea and Julia and the other folks too.

**Dan** *22:46*
Right.

**Gus** *22:47*
And this is the shared context that all three of us will need. Yes, whatever— there's a bunch of different repos, there's a bunch of different documentation areas. I would assume you would want the most granular— yes, yeah, yeah. But you don't want to harvest— no one used an agent to harvest like Confluence docs or anything. You want to just look at source code. Yeah, I know. Probably to understand what libraries they're using or what.

**Nate** *23:19*
I would look for like the most efficient way to— the most uniform way of like doing it for movies or whatever. I'm understanding that like silo teams, they have their own code, they have their own tasks. And then we're working on tasks that test that all the things that were built work together nicely. And then there needs to be something else. Do you have something? That's like—

**Dan** *23:51*
Have a meeting? Yeah. I'm going to start. I have enough. I can generate. I have a lot of questions and some of them might be too dumb to ask and we need to figure out, but I'm going to start generating questions.

**Gus** *24:00*
I don't think so, because they don't have fucking documentation for it. So what I want to spend probably 15 minutes on with Andrea is, to your point, Nate, what is the change management process here? How are teams getting their code to you folks so that you can deliver a release to... Are we even using the right language here? You're delivering a release to cars. I think that's kind of... It's more like an ecosystem map, I think. Like a flow diagram would be super helpful here. I can't believe that they don't—

**Nate** *24:39*
Do they not? Is that why we're here? Is that the whole thing about that stuff? Yeah. I mean, they've just been— we're just the dubs that figured it out.

**Dan** *24:47*
So I will look through— I can also look— Do you think there— I mean, I can look for examples of change management process. Do you have any good— Do you know of any good ones that we might just— to get a baseline of it?

**Nate** *24:57*
Change management process. Yeah. Like, I think like JADS. That's probably the most thing that's more similar. Because like, you have different stages. Or even let me rephrase the process. Like—

**Dan** *25:14*
I can quickly learn about change management processes to get a baseline. Where would the best, what would the best way to start? Would that be? A real one. That's in practice. That's not—

**Nate** *25:26*
Depending on a product where there is one, I'm going to show you. Let me see if I can find one for you tomorrow. I'm going to look and see if I've had one that I used before.

**Dan** *25:42*
Let me see. Going back and forth. Let me see if this describes the change management process.

**Nate** *25:50*
Software development is another thing that you use.

**Gus** *25:55*
Also, maybe search their Google Drive for "change management process."

**Nate** *26:03*
Maybe there's a doc. That's the higher order thing. I was going to— because then that usually sounds like, okay, we have QA involved in this. And then if there's a bug or something happens, here's how it gets reported. Who does it get reported to?

**Dan** *26:21*
Yeah, I was going to see— Thanks for joining us. Yeah, yeah.

**Nate** *26:25*
Do you have any questions?

**Dan** *26:27*
I'm kicking you out. Oh, yes. I'll get kicked out. Yeah. Thank you.
