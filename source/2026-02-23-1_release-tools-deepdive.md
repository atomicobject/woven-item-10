Okay.
*00:01*

**Julia Pralle**: Sorry, just shared a dog with you, let me share my screen as well.
*00:02*

**Julia Pralle**: I just dumped in
*00:05*

**Julia Pralle**: Everything I could think of uh in this document.
*00:08*

**Julia Pralle**: With some more detail oops, some more details basically
*00:12*

**Andrea Zotelli**: You mean all you mean if they will have access to everything that's shown in as as WRD You mean yeah exactly.
*00:16*

**Julia Pralle**: In the end they would need access to everything that's in here
*00:26*

**Julia Pralle**: Um okay so I basically just copied at the beginning the current statement of work.
*00:32*

**Julia Pralle**: Uh yeah, might
*00:39*

**Julia Pralle**: More or less was I think what we had in there.
*00:40*

**Julia Pralle**: I might be a bit more precise down here.
*00:43*

**Julia Pralle**: Because I was trying to figure out what could this all mean in detail for the first epic
*00:45*

**Julia Pralle**: for like the generating uh dynamic tools for you know getting requirements into JAMA.
*00:50*

**Julia Pralle**: That's not my problem right now.
*00:55*

**Julia Pralle**: Um I also have I guess this
*00:57*

**Julia Pralle**: Quick statement of impact because um Kevin needed this as well, so I shared it with him.
*00:59*

**Julia Pralle**: Also Daniel, you have also a good overview of why we're actually doing this, what the impact is for us.
*01:04*

**Julia Pralle**: Um
*01:10*

**Julia Pralle**: even this bigger.
*01:11*

**Julia Pralle**: And then I was trying to have just some notes of what we could actually start with.
*01:13*

**Julia Pralle**: That's a way more concrete of what we can take as an input.
*01:17*

**Julia Pralle**: So just for the requirements work is that
*01:22*

**Julia Pralle**: I would envision that we have any sort of input that we can use to start with.
*01:25*

**Julia Pralle**: It could be a table where we fill in the requirements.
*01:30*

**Julia Pralle**: It could be a document with a table, whatever it is.
*01:32*

**Julia Pralle**: I added here because we do get now from product this kind of document where they have a table for certain
*01:36*

**Julia Pralle**: I don't know.
*01:46*

**Julia Pralle**: No.
*01:49*

**Julia Pralle**: Sorry.
*01:50*

**Julia Pralle**: Where they have nope.
*01:51*

**Julia Pralle**: Um
*01:54*

**Julia Pralle**: some more information about requirements that they will start sharing with us.
*01:57*

**Julia Pralle**: So it can look like where are the requirements.
*02:05*

**Julia Pralle**: Let's do this one.
*02:10*

**Julia Pralle**: Well, it's not very nice.
*02:13*

**Julia Pralle**: But yeah, it it looks more or less a bit like this.
*02:14*

**Julia Pralle**: It should be.
*02:17*

**Julia Pralle**: Wait, I think lane change is in a pretty good state, or is it?
*02:17*

**Julia Pralle**: Main transition here.
*02:22*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*02:25*

**Julia Pralle**: So here you see actually a list of requirements and the link to the original source source.
*02:25*

**Julia Pralle**: So we have like tons of requirements that link to different sources right now.
*02:31*

**Julia Pralle**: And we would like to be more independent from this problem because right now we wouldn't always trying to have a
*02:36*

**Julia Pralle**: an access sheet or anything where we can document all this, go with an approval that we make sure we're on the right version and everything.
*02:42*

**Julia Pralle**: So version control is really messy as it is right now
*02:49*

**Julia Pralle**: So the idea was that we can get any help with that we have one input and this could be the PRD maybe you can use just a table that's the same format or something.
*02:52*

**Julia Pralle**: Um where we input, okay, we get so many requirements, some are coming from Git.
*03:03*

**Julia Pralle**: Well and this how source code is in Git and the other ones could be JAMA.
*03:07*

**Julia Pralle**: I think it's the main two sources I found so far.
*03:12*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay
*03:15*

**Julia Pralle**: We had more in the future, uh in the in the past, but I think for the future we're only gonna use those tools, my understanding.
*03:16*

**Julia Pralle**: So let's focus on them for now
*03:22*

**Julia Pralle**: So let's see, let's say we have any tool, whatever it is, we can input a table with links to the source of the requirement, and then we would like to have that transferred into JAMA.
*03:25*

**Julia Pralle**: And that's that's a bit more of a tricky question, Andrea, where I think you might have to help in, you know, how these requirements are written in Git, for instance, and how they're written in Jama.
*03:37*

**Julia Pralle**: and how we can transfer them into a new item for us in our project with then JAMA have a good stuff we like how do you transfer this best basically this is something where Andrea can help the best
*03:46*

**Julia Pralle**: Um but that's just on a high level basically.
*03:59*

**Julia Pralle**: We have a table with links to multiple sources of requirements.
*04:01*

**Julia Pralle**: We transfer this in our JAMA project.
*04:05*

**Julia Pralle**: So that we have everything in there.
*04:08*

**Julia Pralle**: That's step number one.
*04:10*

**Julia Pralle**: And then what's most important to fix our versioning problem is we need to know if something in the source, in the original source, changes.
*04:12*

**Julia Pralle**: Meaning that if they added another version, if there is any changes, we need to either that's the minimum uh requirement, basically we need to know about it.
*04:21*

**Julia Pralle**: So that in JAMA I know, oh, okay, we have to take a look at these
*04:30*

**Julia Pralle**: five requirements that changed yesterday.
*04:33*

**Julia Pralle**: Let's see what it means for us for all the downstream elements.
*04:36*

**Julia Pralle**: Maybe it was just a typo.
*04:40*

**Julia Pralle**: Good.
*04:41*

**Julia Pralle**: I didn't do anything.
*04:42*

**Julia Pralle**: Good
*04:43*

**Julia Pralle**: When when they change it in Git, at the end of the end.
*04:44*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah, in the original source, in Git or the other JAMA project they're having, right?
*04:46*

**Julia Pralle**: Um that would be the minimum.
*04:50*

**Julia Pralle**: Best of course would be that it automatically adjusts to the new version.
*04:53*

**Julia Pralle**: Because DAMA takes care of the versioning control itself.
*04:58*

**Julia Pralle**: If you change something and you save it, you have a new version automatically.
*05:02*

**Julia Pralle**: So that uh would be the the best version.
*05:06*

**Julia Pralle**: We still need to know about it of course, but it updates dynamically based on the source of the requirement.
*05:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Gotcha
*05:16*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*05:16*

**Gus Schissler**: So just I want to repeat that back.
*05:17*

**Gus Schissler**: One of the questions I had was around how version control works either in Git or in JAMA.
*05:20*

**Gus Schissler**: But it sounds like that, for I mean for Git, that happens automatically.
*05:26*

**Gus Schissler**: For JAMA, it sounds like that happens automatically as well.
*05:30*

**Gus Schissler**: So we're not we're not juggling like making sure a process is followed from a versioning standpoint and then making sure those changes
*05:33*

**Gus Schissler**: just get propagated the versioning process is just happening automatically and we just need to figure out a way to get that into um the the
*05:41*

**Gus Schissler**: end state or the goal JAMA project.
*05:50*

**Julia Pralle**: Exactly.
*05:53*

**Julia Pralle**: Yep.
*05:54*

**Julia Pralle**: Yep.
*05:55*

**Julia Pralle**: So at least within JAMA it's handled on its own.
*05:55*

**Julia Pralle**: So if you you would dynamically update it, it would create a new version.
*05:58*

**Julia Pralle**: Um on the source in Git, I am I I'm not sure if they manually change the version always because they have a tab with versions on there, so you can click through those basically
*06:03*

**Julia Pralle**: Um so that's also something of course you need to figure out within the sources, what do you need, what you you monitor as a trigger to say that there has been a change, right?
*06:15*

**Julia Pralle**: I think that's
*06:26*

**Julia Pralle**: For you to find out what and then Andrea can also help of what's the best indicator within J Dharma project as well.
*06:27*

**Julia Pralle**: It's in the other cool um Git repository, hopefully my understanding.
*06:33*

**Gus Schissler**: So that that makes sense to me.
*06:38*

**Gus Schissler**: So I'm going to repeat back.
*06:40*

**Gus Schissler**: It sounds like there are a few things that we wanna we wanna make sure we hit.
*06:41*

**Gus Schissler**: And that's not only like moving the requirements from all these different sources into JAMA.
*06:46*

**Gus Schissler**: but it's also um we need to figure out the method of transfer like how we're going to do that like what does that tool look like tool chain is there an api is there some sort of connection
*06:50*

**Gus Schissler**: Is it agentic?
*07:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Who knows?
*07:02*

**Gus Schissler**: We can figure that out.
*07:03*

**Gus Schissler**: There might also be some changes around how that content is written or the shape of that content as it's written
*07:05*

**Gus Schissler**: it makes its way into JAMA since some of them are written probably in in different formats or maybe are bulleted format or like uh more
*07:11*

**Gus Schissler**: longer format.
*07:21*

**Gus Schissler**: I I don't know.
*07:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Um and then also being able to solve the republi the problems around like uh version control and updates and making
*07:23*

**Gus Schissler**: making their way continuously into JAMA as well.
*07:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*07:35*

**Julia Pralle**: Exactly.
*07:36*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*07:36*

**Julia Pralle**: And in the uh details and notes below
*07:38*

**Julia Pralle**: And I added like a bunch of stuff that I could think of.
*07:41*

**Julia Pralle**: So one is you have an example basically from a Git repository requirement and um then and here you have an example within JAMA.
*07:44*

**Julia Pralle**: These are the the main
*07:52*

**Julia Pralle**: examples we used before this kind of sheet.
*07:54*

**Julia Pralle**: So if you click into this one, this is where you see what we've done before.
*07:56*

**Julia Pralle**: And we had many different components with requirements.
*08:01*

**Julia Pralle**: And every tab basically you had requirements here.
*08:06*

**Julia Pralle**: And then they would link to the actual requirement and tell us what version we're working based on.
*08:10*

**Julia Pralle**: And then we would go into this and you know say it's approved or pending, whatever it is, basically.
*08:16*

**Julia Pralle**: That's what we did before.
*08:21*

**Julia Pralle**: So these are all the main sources that you might have to deal with.
*08:22*

**Julia Pralle**: But I clicked through most of them and they're all what's leading me to JAMA or Git.
*08:27*

**Julia Pralle**: So I hope that if we get it uh yeah figured out with these two then we we should be all set.
*08:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Awesome.
*08:38*

**Gus Schissler**: I know.
*08:40*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I'm asking a lot of questions.
*08:41*

**Dan Maser**: I wanted to ask a question because I'm looking through it now.
*08:43*

**Dan Maser**: It looks like s we have permission to this, but would this be worth going through and requesting permission for all of the um various
*08:46*

**Julia Pralle**: Link outs or this is more of an example and don't worry about that so yeah the technically yep because I think it these were the main source requirements you will find.
*08:54*

**Julia Pralle**: Um because all I have the best knowledge I have is that these should be look look like what we have on the table.
*09:06*

**Julia Pralle**: Um
*09:13*

**Julia Pralle**: But you know we're all of this is changing on a constant manner.
*09:13*

**Julia Pralle**: So maybe they look different tomorrow, whatever we get from product.
*09:18*

**Julia Pralle**: Um this is what we got last quarter basically.
*09:21*

**Julia Pralle**: So if you don't have access to them, then let Andrea know.
*09:26*

**Julia Pralle**: Then you can just send her the link itself and let her know that you don't have access to it and then she can figure out um how to to get that.
*09:30*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay.
*09:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*09:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Thank you.
*09:38*

**Gus Schissler**: Sorry
*09:38*

**Gus Schissler**: Right.
*09:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Um go ahead, Julia.
*09:40*

**Julia Pralle**: No, what's just thinking the end of requirements?
*09:43*

**Julia Pralle**: I think this
*09:46*

**Julia Pralle**: Oh, and then there's one other thing that you might can uh take a look at.
*09:47*

**Julia Pralle**: We heard from product that they're considering using rectify.
*09:51*

**Julia Pralle**: We haven't had much time to look at the tool itself.
*09:55*

**Julia Pralle**: It sounds like it could be maybe the solution or at least part of the solution.
*09:59*

**Julia Pralle**: It seems to be a tool that pulls in also from different sources.
*10:03*

**Julia Pralle**: And I don't know, builds uh some sort of um linkage within Jama.
*10:10*

**Julia Pralle**: I'm not sure.
*10:16*

**Julia Pralle**: Have you take hadn't uh do you have a chance, Andrea, to take a look?
*10:17*

**Andrea Zotelli**: No, I didn't go further on that.
*10:20*

**Andrea Zotelli**: I just saw the
*10:22*

**Andrea Zotelli**: the first page and but yeah apparently from what they said uh it does all the traceability thing
*10:24*

**Gus Schissler**: Interesting.
*10:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*10:34*

**Julia Pralle**: I think that'd be that's something that you think yeah maybe is already a good solution, then
*10:35*

**Julia Pralle**: We can take next steps there and see if this is something that you know because I only heard from product that they're considering going with this one.
*10:42*

**Gus Schissler**: Gotcha.
*10:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*10:49*

**Gus Schissler**: So what I'm kind of what I'm hearing and this is Dana and I talked about this
*10:50*

**Gus Schissler**: this morning.
*10:56*

**Gus Schissler**: Um something that might be helpful is doing like maybe something more akin to like a traditional
*10:57*

**Gus Schissler**: like user interview with Julia one-on-one with you, Andrea, you as well.
*11:08*

**Gus Schissler**: I think like it'd be helpful to gather
*11:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Like a few different ideas and things around like what do you do right now?
*11:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Like what's the most difficult parts?
*11:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Um I know the I don't want to take too many steps back towards like
*11:23*

**Gus Schissler**: user and discovery side of things, but I think that having those conversations will help Dan and I kind of really establish the groundwork and the basic understanding of what we're trying to think
*11:27*

**Gus Schissler**: solve here.
*11:38*

**Gus Schissler**: And then we can probably apply that to rectify and see like where the overlaps are, how they connect.
*11:39*

**Gus Schissler**: What are you that's kind of like our first major step.
*11:47*

**Gus Schissler**: I would say is like hearing from you folks, being able to internalize all that information and present that back to you as a like a here's what we believe we need to be solving.
*11:51*

**Gus Schissler**: at this point.
*12:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Um yeah.
*12:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*12:04*

**Gus Schissler**: Um we could probably schedule those for this week, but my calendar is pretty
*12:05*

**Gus Schissler**: open this week Dan and I think yours is pretty open too.
*12:11*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah mine should be good.
*12:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Um so from I mean from that perspective um
*12:17*

**Gus Schissler**: From scheduling perspective, Julia, is there a like a list of people that we should talk to to kind of understand um
*12:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Kind of like what I was getting at before.
*12:31*

**Gus Schissler**: Like I know you obviously.
*12:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Um, but if there's a list of folks and then I'm assuming we can just find time on their Google calendars and grab that time and then
*12:34*

**Gus Schissler**: uh start running.
*12:41*

**Dan Maser**: I Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.
*12:42*

**Dan Maser**: I was gonna say I know we had the list earlier of like the who we should get to know list, um, but I know that was for the general that was for all the various people.
*12:45*

**Dan Maser**: So it yeah, I think
*12:52*

**Dan Maser**: going off of what what the the two of you think would actually make sense i is is even better, if that makes sense, Jess.
*12:54*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*13:02*

**Julia Pralle**: I'm adding the list to the Oh you are wonderful.
*13:04*

**Dan Maser**: Thank you so much.
*13:08*

**Julia Pralle**: It's definitely gonna be Andrea.
*13:09*

**Julia Pralle**: I mean you see here already.
*13:10*

**Julia Pralle**: And then Andrea, you think I can have?
*13:13*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*13:15*

**Julia Pralle**: Right.
*13:16*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*13:18*

**Julia Pralle**: I'm wondering if
*13:20*

**Julia Pralle**: If he should pull in Sanshiv as well for this?
*13:25*

**Julia Pralle**: What do you think?
*13:28*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Yeah, I was thinking of this, of him too.
*13:30*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah, because he's pretty he has a pretty good idea also of of what we need.
*13:33*

**Julia Pralle**: Cause we had like a
*13:37*

**Julia Pralle**: Three weeks ago we had a workshop with product basically uh where we were chunking down a lot of these, you know, what is our intake, where we get our requirements, we wanted to have change all of this
*13:38*

**Julia Pralle**: And we ended up at on the PRDs which is linked there as to know they're gonna consolidate all of these requirements at least in one list for us on a quarterly basis
*13:47*

**Julia Pralle**: that we can take this in.
*13:56*

**Julia Pralle**: It still means that it's not in in the right format that we need it, but at least we know where to find it now.
*13:57*

**Julia Pralle**: And then we can that's why we need, you know, your project to pull this in and then have it in Jamon wake way uh and work from there.
*14:03*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*14:10*

**Julia Pralle**: And Sanji pulled together a lot of this information and made a chart of it so you also have a pretty good understanding of what we need.
*14:11*

**Julia Pralle**: So I'm gonna add him as well.
*14:20*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Yeah.
*14:21*

**Julia Pralle**: I think that should be enough.
*14:22*

**Julia Pralle**: Because the rest of the team is basically just getting started on all this.
*14:23*

**Julia Pralle**: So we're just happy to have it if it's there finally.
*14:27*

**Gus Schissler**: Sounds awesome.
*14:30*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Sanjeev is an R for Tumbei too.
*14:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Oh cool.
*14:34*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Sanjeev is an R for Yeah, he's an L yeah.
*14:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Sweet.
*14:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Um Juliet, was that um
*14:38*

**Gus Schissler**: That workshop that you had with product, was that recorded by any chance?
*14:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Like I wouldn't it sounds like you folks made a lot of progress in terms of like consult at least getting requirements to something.
*14:45*

**Gus Schissler**: Um from your perspective, would that be useful to watch?
*14:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Is it not that useful?
*14:56*

**Julia Pralle**: I think it might be more confusing than useful to answer.
*14:58*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay, okay.
*15:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*15:01*

**Julia Pralle**: Um because uh we had like uh it was part for us as well, the first couple of
*15:02*

**Julia Pralle**: Days.
*15:07*

**Julia Pralle**: Days, yeah.
*15:08*

**Julia Pralle**: And the end where we summarize everything, like the wrap-up session might be a good one.
*15:09*

**Julia Pralle**: There we had like the final, you know, everything consolidated and what the next steps, what are we what have we decided basically?
*15:15*

**Julia Pralle**: I don't know if there's too much for you as uh in terms of takeaways because we're talking a lot about acronyms um that are pretty painful
*15:21*

**Julia Pralle**: But um that's the one I could add here.
*15:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, that would be fantastic.
*15:32*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Yeah, I think the wrap-up session would be good.
*15:33*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Cool.
*15:36*

**Andrea Zotelli**: And I would have the in the summary they have also the the note, right?
*15:36*

**Julia Pralle**: The notes are pretty good.
*15:40*

**Julia Pralle**: We have a good list of notes.
*15:41*

**Julia Pralle**: So Nick from our tomb team did like a fantastic job of, you know.
*15:44*

**Julia Pralle**: Uh summarizing everything and we have every single session recorded and transcripted by Gemini.
*15:48*

**Gus Schissler**: that there was like a single like maybe like half day workshop, but it sounds like there was a much longer the entire week.
*16:00*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Okay.
*16:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*16:07*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Multiple stages.
*16:08*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*16:10*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Yeah
*16:10*

**Gus Schissler**: Um, but if you I mean if you mentioned they were transcripted, um the Atomic's been working on
*16:11*

**Gus Schissler**: lately building uh what we call like a project knowledge base.
*16:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Um it's kind of like a a working brain or memory um that uses transcripts as a source of truth
*16:25*

**Gus Schissler**: kind of feeds them through some agentic models in order to generate um like bronze, silver, gold information that can be synthesized and automated.
*16:31*

**Gus Schissler**: If you're cool with sharing those transcripts with us, I think
*16:41*

**Gus Schissler**: think it would be good context um uh to maybe has as some some groundwork um just trying to explore like what are all of the different pieces of data that we can start thinking about and playing with
*16:44*

**Gus Schissler**: right now to help us build a little bit more of that context, I think.
*16:57*

**Gus Schissler**: Um that that could be cool if you feel comfortable with sharing that.
*17:00*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah, I'll add the the links to the meeting notes.
*17:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Awesome.
*17:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Thank you
*17:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Thank you very much so much.
*17:10*

**Julia Pralle**: Sure.
*17:12*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay.
*17:13*

**Julia Pralle**: I think that's it.
*17:15*

**Julia Pralle**: And then uh architecture diagram, I'm going to discuss then right with Nate when he's
*17:16*

**Julia Pralle**: Joining did you join this week?
*17:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Is that my Yeah, so I think uh I talked with Sam this morning.
*17:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Um he said he opened up the request to get Nate onboarded and a laptop.
*17:29*

**Gus Schissler**: pop um I think last Thursday or Friday or something like that.
*17:36*

**Gus Schissler**: So um the re the reason why Nate is not in this meeting tonight is because um we just got back from uh offset
*17:40*

**Gus Schissler**: in Arizona on Friday and Saturday and Sunday.
*17:48*

**Gus Schissler**: And he his flight back left at like midnight Arizona time.
*17:51*

**Gus Schissler**: So he I I work with another guy on a different uh project that he said he find
*17:56*

**Gus Schissler**: got home at like 6 45 this morning east coast time so Nate's recovering um but uh our goal like Dan and mine's goal we're gonna
*18:02*

**Gus Schissler**: We'll bring him along for the ride until he gets all of his access and stuff set up because all of the contacts that we'll be establishing will also be helpful contacts for
*18:13*

**Gus Schissler**: to establish as well.
*18:22*

**Gus Schissler**: So we'll be doing a lot of that knowledge transmission this week um too.
*18:23*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*18:28*

**Julia Pralle**: And I was also assuming any first eats time to set up everything right with IT and because yeah
*18:28*

**Julia Pralle**: Get the internet copy everything.
*18:34*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay.
*18:36*

**Dan Maser**: It took I will say the setup for me, it was pretty minimal.
*18:36*

**Dan Maser**: The only real friction was
*18:40*

**Dan Maser**: Honestly, Muhammad talking to IT and I think they grabbed the wrong laptop and then then gave me the right laptop.
*18:42*

**Dan Maser**: But the actual setup was pretty painless.
*18:48*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*18:52*

**Dan Maser**: So I I I sat right next to IT and they and then you know there's a little bit of getting access to the correct repos, which took a little bit of time additionally.
*18:53*

**Dan Maser**: But honestly that
*19:02*

**Dan Maser**: because y'all are, you know, global, none of that that was mostly just done within a day.
*19:04*

**Dan Maser**: So he can get a laptop immediately, I think I feel pretty confident that he can get on board pretty fast.
*19:10*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*19:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay, sounds good.
*19:15*

**Gus Schissler**: From from my experience I've done
*19:16*

**Gus Schissler**: My a lot of my prior consulting work has been with the federal government and you folks are blowing them out of the water in terms of access.
*19:19*

**Julia Pralle**: So Okay, yeah, I'm not surprised about that on the line.
*19:27*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah.
*19:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Um so it's been I I echo what
*19:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Dan.
*19:33*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, within like two or three days, I think I had most of my access, and then there were just some odds and ends, I think, that Andrea helped help us get
*19:34*

**Dan Maser**: But yeah, yeah, Andrea, you were fantastic with that.
*19:43*

**Dan Maser**: So thank you.
*19:46*

**Dan Maser**: You were the first.
*19:46*

**Dan Maser**: I just have to say.
*19:47*

**Julia Pralle**: Thank you.

**Julia Pralle**: Nice.
*19:50*

**Julia Pralle**: Cool.
*19:52*

**Julia Pralle**: Awesome.
*19:52*

**Julia Pralle**: And you also have uh already access to the code base itself?
*19:53*

**Gus Schissler**: I some of the repos I believe the three repos that um I think Mohammed asked us to get access to so there's
*19:57*

**Gus Schissler**: There's uh autonomy, there's Togo or Togo.
*20:05*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*20:11*

**Gus Schissler**: And then the 13th floor, or I think it's called something.
*20:12*

**Dan Maser**: something else um mercury or something like that I'm not quite sure okay yeah we get Stargate Mercury which is 13th floor we have the TMC autonomy and then we have the two go
*20:18*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay, yeah, that should be all yeah, that should be enough.
*20:31*

**Julia Pralle**: Yep.
*20:34*

*20:40*

**Gus Schissler**: be helpful for just keeping it a good pulse.
*20:45*

**Gus Schissler**: Do we want to use, I know we moved some of that requirements overview to um
*20:49*

**Gus Schissler**: um tomorrow afternoon, um afternoon for us.
*20:55*

**Gus Schissler**: We could still keep that time and keep on discussing if you'd like.
*21:00*

**Gus Schissler**: We can move it.
*21:05*

**Julia Pralle**: That's right now
*21:07*

**Andrea Zotelli**: Yeah, Monday and Tuesday, Monday and Thursday I have another meeting at the same time.

**Gus Schissler**: Or we can so what I want to figure out is
*21:38*

**Gus Schissler**: Like how do we one learn quickly?
*21:42*

**Gus Schissler**: And then two, how do we show you folks that we're learning quickly throughout this first and and second week?
*21:47*

**Gus Schissler**: So I want to
*21:52*

**Gus Schissler**: And you folks have been incredibly responsive on Slack, so it's not about like waiting on you folks to get things done, but I want to just like bring you along as we're learning and discovering things and able to like build
*21:54*

**Gus Schissler**: some rapport as as well.
*22:07*

**Gus Schissler**: So um it doesn't have to be daily is what I'm saying, but I I think more communication as opposed to less.
*22:09*

**Gus Schissler**: right now is helpful.
*22:16*

**Julia Pralle**: Yeah, I agree.
*22:17*

**Julia Pralle**: So so first of all it it looks like we can then oh I'm still in the and it's gonna

**Julia Pralle**: So we can either because we have tomorrow the overview, which we basically did today.
*22:28*

**Julia Pralle**: And then we could leave the daily standup.
*22:38*

*23:15*

**Julia Pralle**: Okay.

*23:23*

**Julia Pralle**: We can be flexible there, whatever works best.
*23:30*

**Julia Pralle**: Or if you have something to show, just sketch us something.
*23:32*

**Gus Schissler**: I think the the I mean the main action item that I'm taking away is to get some time on your folks' calendars to kind of talk through and get uh like deeper.
*23:36*

**Gus Schissler**: understanding.
*23:45*

**Gus Schissler**: So um if we miss some stand-ups I think that'll be fine.
