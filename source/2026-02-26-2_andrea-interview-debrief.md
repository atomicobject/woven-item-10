**Gus Schissler**: How big is the backlog?
*00:05*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*00:06*

**Dan Maser**: And then when she's like, It's huge, I'm like perfect.
*00:06*

**Dan Maser**: So that's our problem.
*00:09*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*00:11*

**Dan Maser**: I don't need to worry about post-backlog world.
*00:12*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*00:14*

**Gus Schissler**: This is w I had the sneaking suspicion that this would be the shape of things when Julia said like, Oh yeah, it's all each team has their own process of writing things down
*00:15*

**Gus Schissler**: And I'm like, no, they don't.
*00:28*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*00:31*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, like I there are plenty of things as a product manager that I've just never written down.
*00:32*

**Gus Schissler**: Like
*00:36*

**Gus Schissler**: So it's you have a good point, like if we get something to scrape documentation or whatnot, and we just unearth a bunch of T
*00:37*

**Gus Schissler**: PPDs that we need to talk to people about anyway, what's the point?
*00:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Which but the idea that I did have was if there was a single location for this all to be documented
*00:49*

**Gus Schissler**: documented somewhere or like a hint for the documentation.
*00:56*

**Gus Schissler**: It would be in the code.
*01:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*01:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Right?
*01:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Like the code.
*01:02*

**Nate Papes**: That's the source of truth, yeah.
*01:03*

**Nate Papes**: Absolutely.
*01:05*

**Nate Papes**: Right.
*01:06*

**Gus Schissler**: So that might and I don't I don't want a solution at this point, but understanding what's written in the code or being able to summarize what's written in the code.
*01:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Code could especially if it's written well, like with normal class names, like descriptive class names and variable names and stuff.
*01:15*

**Nate Papes**: It's English like semantically it's never gonna be different.
*01:27*

**Nate Papes**: That's a good point.
*01:31*

**Nate Papes**: That's the stuff that I need in uh Japanese or the web.
*01:34*

**Nate Papes**: Right.
*01:38*

**Nate Papes**: Um you know.
*01:39*

**Dan Maser**: That that was my other question though, and again I know we're not solutioning here, but even if it's I asked that question about order.
*01:40*

**Dan Maser**: If there is no order on the flip side, if if sh
*01:47*

**Dan Maser**: She can find that like this component is 90% TBD and this component is 10% TBD.
*01:50*

**Dan Maser**: Work on that one.
*01:58*

**Dan Maser**: But even if if our tool does that, that seems like that.
*02:00*

**Dan Maser**: would gain a massive edge and then cause even like oh I know that these TBD I can schedule those out later or whatever like it sounds like even prioritization would
*02:04*

**Gus Schissler**: help because this makes a lot of sense why they want like a automatic architecture diagram too is
*02:15*

**Gus Schissler**: I wonder how many years of code or how many years of development they've been working on.
*02:25*

**Gus Schissler**: without these requirements because it sounds like it's more than a couple years.
*02:35*

**Nate Papes**: I think yeah I mean started for it as a whole band it was how to use an institution whatever.
*02:39*

**Nate Papes**: Um and I think I mean they're talking about like self-driving, so I mean that's like an insanely hard problem.
*02:46*

**Nate Papes**: Right.
*02:53*

**Nate Papes**: I I don't even think the developers can even
*02:54*

**Nate Papes**: Like properly documented properly.
*02:56*

**Gus Schissler**: So no wonder why they're resistant to to it
*03:04*

**Gus Schissler**: And humans are bad at writing documentation anyway.
*03:08*

**Nate Papes**: Yeah, and then when you write it, it's gonna be out of data, but when you write it, it's gonna be something that's so confident.
*03:11*

**Nate Papes**: Like what from her standpoint
*03:16*

**Nate Papes**: Like just lane change system, like just defining that, like yeah, but like the granularity level thing never.
*03:18*

**Nate Papes**: How
*03:27*

**Nate Papes**: How would you write that?
*03:29*

**Nate Papes**: I guess I'd have to look at an example of how their other documentation looks like.
*03:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*03:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Let me um realize that could be either a follow-up session or it could be just asking.
*03:35*

**Gus Schissler**: Andrea, like is there a good example of requirements that you've written and the documentation that you looked at to write them?
*03:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Are you making a note for that?
*03:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*03:55*

**Gus Schissler**: Sweet.
*03:56*

**Dan Maser**: It's it's it's not super organized, but yes.
*03:56*

**Gus Schissler**: That's okay.
*03:59*

**Gus Schissler**: Um it saves me from writing it down.
*03:59*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, also, I mean, all of this makes sense.
*04:02*

**Dan Maser**: Like, whether it's will it actually like I get the pen tension of like sometimes it like won't like engineers documentation makes engineers go s
*04:04*

**Dan Maser**: slower sometimes it can speed it up in the long run.
*04:13*

**Dan Maser**: But that aside, needing the needing this to get stuff on the road for us for lack of a better word, a CYA.
*04:16*

**Dan Maser**: Like if there's any
*04:21*

**Gus Schissler**: Anything that goes wrong you need that information.
*04:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*04:26*

**Gus Schissler**: Um I wanna I'm curious to run
*04:28*

**Gus Schissler**: Maybe we can make a few updates to the boards, but I'm I'd be curious to just run that exact same conversation with Julia to
*04:36*

**Gus Schissler**: to see what it's like from her perspective and see if we get the same.
*04:44*

**Gus Schissler**: Because I think there's Andrea's question at the end is maybe I think she's not either totally aware or totally aligned with Julia's perspective.
*04:47*

**Dan Maser**: either.
*04:57*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*04:57*

**Gus Schissler**: Which is why she asked us like, what do you guys think the problem you're solving is?
*04:58*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah I love I loved that question.
*05:02*

**Gus Schissler**: It was it was great.
*05:04*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*05:09*

**Gus Schissler**: Cause maybe to Julia it's from Julia's perspective, it's not a communication problem.
*05:10*

**Gus Schissler**: Or maybe
*05:16*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't know.
*05:19*

**Gus Schissler**: Like I I'd be really curious to run that same conversation.
*05:19*

**Nate Papes**: How fresh is Andrea now?
*05:24*

**Gus Schissler**: She started in October of last year.
*05:26*

**Dan Maser**: So wait wait.
*05:29*

**Dan Maser**: So like of twenty twenty-five.
*05:30*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*05:33*

**Dan Maser**: So fresh.
*05:33*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*05:34*

**Gus Schissler**: Hannah would be another good person to talk to because she said that Hannah was
*05:35*

**Gus Schissler**: like uh over a year into her time.
*05:40*

**Gus Schissler**: And Hannah's on the list of people that Julia and Andrea said we should interview.
*05:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*05:49*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, it'd be interesting for her to hear one scenario.
*05:52*

**Dan Maser**: Because I do I still am grappling with how much they want this to be like how much do they want us to for lack of a better word, they're in a
*05:55*

**Dan Maser**: hole and they want to get out of the hole.
*06:03*

**Dan Maser**: Do they also want us to implement something that like software teams are s they're working on software right now
*06:06*

**Nate Papes**: Mm-hmm.
*06:14*

**Dan Maser**: So theoretically the hole keeps getting bigger.
*06:14*

**Dan Maser**: So do they also want us to create something right now that doesn't add to the hole?
*06:17*

**Gus Schissler**: That sounds like a separate thing.
*06:23*

**Dan Maser**: Oh like it stops the bleeding?
*06:24*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*06:25*

**Gus Schissler**: It sounds like they have they don't have enough people for that because that that what they were talking about from the V model is a process change, not a tool
*06:27*

**Gus Schissler**: change.
*06:37*

**Gus Schissler**: You guys can't don't work on software until we give you requirements for it.
*06:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*06:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Is essentially the the paradigm shift that
*06:44*

**Gus Schissler**: they need to make inside their organization.
*06:47*

**Gus Schissler**: And at that point, like there'll be a different manual process or a different automated process for just getting the requirements from the user designs.
*06:49*

**Gus Schissler**: Right into Java and then passing those on to the team.
*06:59*

**Gus Schissler**: So I don't think we're solving back box theme.
*07:03*

**Gus Schissler**: But it'd be cool to confirm with Julia around that too.
*07:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Right.
*07:10*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*07:12*

**Dan Maser**: From Andrea's perspective, there's a massive hole and that seems like the massive priority.
*07:12*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*07:17*

**Dan Maser**: Which is great.
*07:18*

**Dan Maser**: Cool.
*07:21*

**Dan Maser**: Great job.
*07:21*

**Gus Schissler**: This is like, oh god, things make so much sense.
*07:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*07:26*

**Dan Maser**: It's wild, like I think this is a great example, and I'm not blaming Muhammad, but there's
*07:27*

**Dan Maser**: Just such an easy green.
*07:31*

**Dan Maser**: Like he was just like, Yeah, just talk to the AI bot.
*07:32*

**Dan Maser**: Like in a non-dismissive way.
*07:34*

**Dan Maser**: But he's like, Yeah, you can get everything from the AI bot.
*07:35*

**Nate Papes**: There's links to everything.
*07:37*

**Dan Maser**: And I'm like, and then we had like four conversations, which I feel like they're just sharing stuff.
*07:38*

**Dan Maser**: And I'm like, what the fuck am I looking at?
*07:43*

**Nate Papes**: Yeah.
*07:45*

**Nate Papes**: And that's that's the I felt for you.
*07:45*

**Dan Maser**: I will say the one thing because they're so product focused, I feel like they they were very big into like
*07:49*

**Dan Maser**: Well do these tasks and we're just like, what's the problem though?
*07:53*

**Dan Maser**: Like yeah, like I don't know.
*07:57*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*08:00*

**Nate Papes**: It's like the regulatory like question number one is like what are the requirements?
*08:00*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*08:09*

**Dan Maser**: At least to get her perspective on the problem is really great.
*08:10*

**Dan Maser**: So I think yeah, I think
*08:14*

**Dan Maser**: the one thing we could do before, so I think going back to your point of like let's keep everything the same, I think what would be really powerful before we speak to um to Julia is if we have a better understanding
*08:16*

**Dan Maser**: of what the documentation looks like.
*08:27*

**Dan Maser**: If we can get that going into it, that might be really helpful because we'll have more context on what the documentation looks like.
*08:30*

**Dan Maser**: and that kind of stuff.
*08:38*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*08:41*

**Gus Schissler**: Sweet.
*08:42*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean the the the simple fact that the Andrea doesn't have a checklist of what she needs
*08:42*

**Gus Schissler**: to do is crazy.
*08:48*

**Gus Schissler**: Like they don't know, I think they don't know just like how many components they need to write requirements for.
*08:49*

**Gus Schissler**: So that could also be
*08:57*

**Gus Schissler**: Low-hanging fruit as well.
*09:00*

**Dan Maser**: And I was trying to ask that slightly with like the do you have any patterns that you go like are there any it sounds like every single thing is a novel and new situation.
*09:02*

**Nate Papes**: I heard it from a slide deck or it was a presentation.
*09:11*

**Gus Schissler**: It does sound like there's a that um and I'll send a follow-up message to Andrea.
*09:16*

**Gus Schissler**: around the capabilities spreadsheet that she was talking about.
*09:21*

**Gus Schissler**: So there is a checklist somewhere, right, of like lane
*09:26*

**Gus Schissler**: changing automation is a capability on this software level you mean or I think it's like the system level.
*09:33*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, okay.
*09:41*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*09:42*

**Dan Maser**: And her job is to really distill it all the way down to component
*09:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Yes.
*09:46*

**Dan Maser**: Sorry, I cut you off.
*09:48*

**Gus Schissler**: No, no, no, you're good.
*09:49*

**Gus Schissler**: But at least we we've got to create the denominator.
*09:51*

**Gus Schissler**: somehow and even if it's like super loose from like a here's just all the capabilities we need to address um that would be helpful I think
*09:56*

**Dan Maser**: Anyway, for lack of a better word, her job is such a shit show right now.
*10:07*

**Dan Maser**: I think there's a lot of things that we can do to make her her life easier if that's her job.
*10:10*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, figuring out which one is a big conversation.
*10:15*

**Dan Maser**: That I can't wait to have.
*10:17*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*10:18*

**Dan Maser**: But I feel confident that, like, oh, we can absolutely improve it somehow.
*10:19*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*10:23*

**Gus Schissler**: We'll just give you a therapist AI chat box.
*10:24*

**Dan Maser**: Or you do it, what is that green?
*10:29*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*10:30*

**Gus Schissler**: I'm gonna stop this recording, so we're good
*10:31*
