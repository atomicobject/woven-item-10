**Dan Maser**: Thank you, thank you.
*00:00*

**Gus Schissler**: don't head dog in road kind of thing. And then from there, that goes to… That's broken down into what different systems need to be in place, and for those systems, what software do they need for that to work? And then for that software, what components do they need to build in order for the software to work? So that's the systems, software, component levels.
*00:01*

**Dan Maser**: Gotcha. Okay.
*00:25*

**Gus Schissler**: so it's really easy to say, okay, don't hit the dog in the road. And then for everybody to… and then you, like, it explodes outward with all the different teams and all the different systems that they needed. to build stuff in order for that to work. But then when it comes back to the people who initially said, don't hit the dog in the road. You now have… All of these different signals coming from all these different teams, and… that's where we're supposed to be helping, I think, is like… They need an easy way to… We went from one to many, and they need an easy way to go from many to one, I guess.
*00:26*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. Yes. I think that makes sense.
*01:05*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*01:08*

**Dan Maser**: I think that makes a lot of sense, and… yeah. Alright, I just downloaded this as a markdown. Quick side note, I set up Nate with Obsidian. Although he had… He needed to get the, like, free trial thing. So… Just throwing this in here. I'm throwing this transcript into the context folder. We can reorganize this as such. I'm gonna junk the Wovey question stuff.
*01:12*

**Gus Schissler**: Okay.
*02:05*

**Dan Maser**: Okay. Alright, so I will go back and watch that, too, to get that better context, but I do think we can probably use this time to start looking at the questions.
*02:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep.
*02:22*

**Dan Maser**: Did you look… if you didn't, don't worry, this is not, like, a guilt-trippy thing, did you look at them yet?
*02:23*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I read through them a bit.
*02:28*

**Dan Maser**: I mean, it's so… it's classic… it's classic AI. It's long-winded, it's way too much, but I just wanted to kind of throw all that on there, because it did a pretty good job of, like, just… well, actually, it started way too in-depth, and I really forced it to… to ask some bigger picture questions. But, it eventually got there, but I wanted, like, I was thinking the two of us could kind of basically prune through it. Does this update… if, like, if I start typing in the… it updates in real time, right, the Obsidian file?
*02:30*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't know if it does.
*03:02*

**Dan Maser**: Like, you see that random text after 1? Bitch. Good. Oh, it's… Hmm, okay. That's…
*03:04*

**Gus Schissler**: We're in Notion, it wouldn't, but…
*03:16*

**Dan Maser**: Damn it. Okay, whatever.
*03:18*

**Gus Schissler**: views. With AI.
*03:19*

**Dan Maser**: It's… okay, there it goes. Okay. Anyways, yeah, I was thinking we could kind of prune through these, talk through these, kind of polish them up to… to email out. I mean, I also think the thing that I realized doing through this is, like. we have an hour with each person, and I think what I was realizing is, like, there's the, like, big picture discovery that I think we still want clarification on, and then there's, like, the follow-up JAMA integration questions, which, like, I think we'll have to get those later.
*03:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Hmm.
*03:52*

**Dan Maser**: If that makes sense. I don't know, there's just a lot to ask, basically.
*03:53*

**Gus Schissler**: Yep.
*03:58*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, dude. Okay. But, yeah, I was thinking we could kind of go through these just to get baseline questions. Now, granted, we might have more answers to some of these, given, like, that video that you watched, thank you, and I'll look through that. But, yeah, I mean, what's your thought on, in terms of, like. big picture questions. I mean, like, I'm looking at these first 5, really, on here. Yeah, and our thoughts on these, and how we can polish these, or ask them, or not ask them?
*04:00*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, just reading through one more time.
*04:38*

**Dan Maser**: to her.
*04:43*

**Gus Schissler**: Part of me is wondering, like, how much do we… Ask them to explain it, or how much do we just… Mock something up in… FigJam, or Miro, or something, and show them what we think we know, and then they can… Correct. that. The areas where we don't. No, or don't have enough context.
*04:47*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, and I think… first of all, this is super minor, I don't really care. Do you prefer FigJam or Miro?
*05:10*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't care.
*05:16*

**Dan Maser**: I don't really care, like, I would say, like, if I was doing anything in Figma, I prefer FigJam, but I don't think I'm gonna touch Figma for this, so… Yeah. I don't care either. I like that a lot. I think that also might… yeah. Like, I think that also will save time, because I think, worst case scenario. you know, Julia, it might be a little rough for the first one, but by the next interviews, it's just kind of validating that and brushing up on that. So, let's… Yes.
*05:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Well, if we wanted to meet with Andrea first, too.
*05:48*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah, God. Yup I like it. Do you see my comments now being left? Because I see it is updating in green in the bottom right.
*05:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I do… I see… mock something up in Miro.
*06:02*

**Dan Maser**: Have them verify.
*06:05*

**Gus Schissler**: No, it's probably just slower.
*06:09*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, it was going really fast today, I don't… the sync now says it's indexing, which… okay, now it should be good. Okay.
*06:11*

**Gus Schissler**: Keep in mind, I don't think the Obsidian Sync isn't supposed to be…
*06:22*

**Dan Maser**: Spontaneous.
*06:27*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, instantaneous. Okay.
*06:28*

**Dan Maser**: Okay .
*06:38*

**Gus Schissler**: So, like, 4 we don't need.
*06:42*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. Yeah, so what is the current change management process? Because they don't have one?
*06:45*

**Gus Schissler**: No, they… they do have one, it's that V shape.
*06:51*

**Dan Maser**: Gotcha. Oh, yeah, because we've already… With the questions above, they're explaining what the change management process is. Yup.
*06:54*

**Gus Schissler**: So…
*07:03*

**Dan Maser**: I deleted that, sorry. Good point. How many teams are contributing code? We… you didn't get that from that video, do they?
*07:05*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, I have no idea.
*07:11*

**Dan Maser**: Okay. Is there a single integration point where all the team's code comes together, or does it happen in stages? Is this…
*07:13*

**Gus Schissler**: It's like a, well, you know eventually there is.
*07:22*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*07:30*

**Gus Schissler**: Single integration point, but it's like, are there other, like, smaller integration points before that Big integration happens.
*07:31*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, because from the other… oh, sorry, keep going.
*07:40*

**Gus Schissler**: And that might come out of the questions that we ask above.
*07:43*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, because what we already have from this is, There's a single… for the TMC driving codebase, everything lands in a single master branch. There are no release branches or long-lived feature branches. All contributors merge to the upstream master, so I think, to your point, it's really more so, like. Before… how did you word that? Before it gets to the…
*07:46*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, the… what's going into the vehicle, I guess. Right?
*08:14*

**Dan Maser**: Well, what I was saying is, like, we know from the video that there is a singular… There is a single integration point for the TMC driving codebase. It lands in a single master branch. and it merges to the upstream master, but I think what you're getting at is, like, like, are there, like, is it… are there stages to this single, like, is there, like… I think it's more of, like, the question is more, what are the stages that it takes to get to a single integration point? Is that fair to say?
*08:19*

**Gus Schissler**: Partially. The other part is, like, are… do, like, breaking and perception merge first, like, together? Like, do teams meet up before they go to a… Final, unified… Build, or whatever.
*08:55*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, and does it… and does it contain multiple teams?
*09:14*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*09:19*

**Dan Maser**: Is that…
*09:20*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*09:21*

**Dan Maser**: And are you talking about, just to go back to your visual, are you talking about the changelog, the code, both?
*09:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Both. All of the above. Like, the… I wanna know… Are they… How many times are things merging together before it gets to them? Right? Because if…
*09:31*

**Dan Maser**: Or it gets to the video. Or to the vehicle.
*09:44*

**Gus Schissler**: Before it gets to the product delivery team.
*09:47*

**Dan Maser**: Because I want to know, like.
*09:50*

**Gus Schissler**: are we interacting with 10 different things that can update at any time? Are we updating it with… or are we interacting with 5 different things that each have their own, like, connections to 2 to 5 other things that are also talking to each other and updating on their own? So it's like, how far are we removed from.
*09:51*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. What these changelogs look like. Is this answered in number one, if we… if we mock up the flow, or… This is more of a verification on that.
*10:11*

**Gus Schissler**: It's… yeah, it's a verification on that. Like, I… I think… 2, 3, and 4, like, this entire thing is probably just a… Make sure we hit these points when we talk about the big picture.
*10:22*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, I'm gonna add that. Yes. Yes. For number 4… Hey, Nate!
*10:34*

**Gus Schissler**: It ain't…
*10:50*

**Nathan Papes**: Amy? Alright, there we go.
*10:50*

**Dan Maser**: Well, I'm realizing… should I just share my screen?
*10:53*

**Gus Schissler**: That might be… easier.
*10:56*

**Dan Maser**: Nate, we're just walking through these questions.
*11:00*

**Nathan Papes**: Nope. Change the revenue. Yeah, I, I grazed through them. I didn't leave… I didn't mark it up or anything. I want to hear your… your thoughts on them first. Because, honestly, I still don't really have the context to have, like, an opinion on any of this.
*11:03*

**Dan Maser**: So what we did… what we've done… Gus talked about, like, walking through the wrap-up video, which is super helpful, and he shared that V shape. And really all we've been doing right now is just talking about this, like, big picture, which is really just, like. we were talking about, like, just mocking up in Miro, like, just that, that, like. That flow for this system. And just verifying that we are correct in our assumption of the flow. And then, yeah, I think you're right, Gus, like, number 4 is similar, like, it's just, like, what comes along with it. And I think, along with this question, we also want to know, like, what of this process is manual? Or do we already know that it's manual?
*11:26*

**Gus Schissler**: Right, yeah.
*12:18*

**Dan Maser**: Alright, let me say, what… Which, er… It's almost like, which of these… our manual… Lead generated versus automatically.
*12:22*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, I think test results is probably automatically generated, but someone's manually going and collecting them, I think. Yeah. And that's why…
*12:40*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, oh, yes.
*12:49*

**Gus Schissler**: that's what Casey and Rebecca, I think, are working on, is, like, automating the capture and grabbing of these test results, or, like, baking them into their CICD, or… Yeah.
*12:50*

**Dan Maser**: Yes.
*13:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Cool.
*13:06*

**Dan Maser**: Alright, I feel good about these. I mean, I think the big action step now, that we don't have to… like, we can do this after we get the questions, but mock, like. trying to put it together in Miro would be really important to do.
*13:07*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. Cool. So this is, like… This first section, the big picture, like, we want to understand… what's happening. And then… the… and I think this gets into… The next section known, not to skip ahead, but… is, like, what is what product delivery is doing? Like, what is it that they do that contributes to a release?
*13:20*

**Dan Maser**: like.
*13:54*

**Gus Schissler**: Like, what… they're saying we're… Gathering all the requirements. How does that impact a release, or, like, what role does that have? In a release. Like, why are we doing it, essentially?
*13:54*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, yes. Yeah, I think… Yeah, it's like the cada… it's understanding the… I don't want to use the word cadence, but… because it's in there, but it's like, yeah, better understanding the cadence… and the… process of the integration?
*14:06*

**Gus Schissler**: I don't wanna… No, it's mostly just, like. Why are they doing what they're doing?
*14:28*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*14:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Right? It's like, why don't the teams just merge their code into whatever integration environment? Or, like, gathering environment on their own. Like, why do they need… why do we need product delivery? Like, what is product delivery's role? In this, like, big picture.
*14:41*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*15:00*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, I'm almost curious if it's the… whatever that program you had up, Dan, yesterday, that had that requirements? Like, tree, like, file tree looking thing, and you can, like, click into it. like, I wonder if that's, like, the main source of truth, and we have to align a system To ensure, like, each… like, there's, like, a test case for each one of those line items.
*15:01*

**Dan Maser**: Trying to think of what tree I had up.
*15:31*

**Nathan Papes**: It was a… it was a software I haven't seen before. It was…
*15:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*15:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*15:38*

**Nathan Papes**: Jama, JAMA, so…
*15:39*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, I'd have it on my other computer, of course, yeah.
*15:40*

**Nathan Papes**: I have a feeling… that seemed pretty, like, proprietary, and something that's not, like. I don't know, standard? So, I have a feeling that might be something to do with this.
*15:45*

**Dan Maser**: I think that's their desired… that's their desired output, right? Is that it all goes into JAMA? JAMA?
*15:58*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, like, then I would suspect that software can then, produce an output that's, like, pretty, or whatever. That's in, like, the style that I would like. So we have to take output from a CI-CD pipeline, say, Azure or something, and each team, we have to make sure, like, hooks up into that, and then… Azure as a hookup in the JAMA.
*16:04*

**Gus Schissler**: I think it's, like, one step beyond that as well, because it's the… It's not necessarily what's happening in the pipeline, it's what's… What's being changed. Like, they don't…
*16:34*

**Nathan Papes**: they…
*16:51*

**Gus Schissler**: when… We need to talk to them about testing as well, like, who's doing the testing, what are the different testing stages look like, stuff like that, but it's not, like, CI tests. they're… like… Each of these requirements has, like, a mirror… Test for it. And so the JAMA requirements are a gathering of all of the different potential Requirements and their test cases for those things that are either tested by a system, or a simulation, or a human. And so, the… they… I think they know what all the… one of the questions I want to ask them is, I think they know what all the requirements might be. But they might not know what all the testing… Needs are. So, like, the other side of the V, essentially.
*16:52*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh, okay, I see.
*17:45*

**Gus Schissler**: And that's… and what I was explaining to Dan when we first joined was, like, the idea is… with the V shape, this is what I was reading last night, like, you start with just the user need. And from there… All of these different systems and teams start building out Like, you start in the upper left corner. Like, don't hit the dog in the road. I need to think of a better thing before we do a user interview, but don't hit the dog in the road. And then there are…
*17:46*

**Dan Maser**: Don't hit,
*18:13*

**Gus Schissler**: Mailbox. Don't have a mailbox.
*18:16*

**Dan Maser**: Thank you. Yes, don't hit a mailbox. On a turn.
*18:17*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. And then that goes… that's, like, the user story. Like, the super high-level user story that's… what needs to be done. And then from there. this… this V shape is, like, one slice of everything, because there are multiple systems, there's multiple sets of software, and there are multiple components, so it's, like. Fractaling outwards. So, at each step, you're getting, like. More and more requirements, or software components, or what have you. So that rapidly gets out of their purview. Like, they know, okay, we're not hitting a mailbox, but as soon as they give that to all the teams, they immediately lose track of all the requirements. Which means they also don't know what all the tests are.
*18:20*

**Dan Maser**: Because the requirements are slightly different per team, right? Because they're all based on that team's work.
*19:07*

**Gus Schissler**: So the high-level requirements are the same. Right. But, like, if we're talking about, like, empowered product teams here, the teams are in charge of figuring out how to solve their own problem. Like, perceptions… problem to solve is, how do I know what a mailbox is?
*19:14*

**Dan Maser**: Right, exactly. That's what I'm trying to get at. Like, so for perception, it turns into, like, don't hit a mailbox, turns into, like, understand what all the mailboxes look like, and if there's an object that is this type, then steer away from it. That's not the correct answer. But, like, that's what you're kind of trying to say, right?
*19:31*

**Gus Schissler**: That's what the software that they have, like, the middle section, is, like, perception, I think. And then beyond that, there are probably multiple teams that are doing, like, object recognition, so they have their own requirements. Then there are, like, persistence teams, maybe, that says, like, oh, we can track an object over time, like, maybe they have requirements, so it's like… There are multiple sub-teams within just the perception team of identifying mailbox that have their own, like, functionality and rules and whatnot that they need to build. And each team's also building their test cases, so that's the other side of the V.
*19:46*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*20:26*

**Gus Schissler**: So, once we get all the way to the bottom of the V, this one, like, user story, like, don't hit the mailbox, is now probably, like, hundreds of requirements across all of the different teams.
*20:27*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*20:39*

**Gus Schissler**: And… sure, it goes out and gets developed, and then it bubbles its way back up to the team when they say, okay, we're ready for you to test and approve our changes. It works locally for them, but the, I think. The problem that we're trying to solve is the product delivery team has no idea what all of the requirements are that all of the teams have just magically generated.
*20:40*

**Dan Maser**: Because that hasn't been mapped, that hasn't been charted, or if so, it's all being done manually, no one's keeping track of it, so… yeah.
*21:02*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*21:10*

**Dan Maser**: And I think what they want is it to basically populate in JAMA and cascade up and track all of that, correct? Or something like that.
*21:12*

**Gus Schissler**: I think JAMA does that for us automatically.
*21:21*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*21:24*

**Gus Schissler**: I think JAMA has, like, you could add a user story or a requirement, and then you can have all the cascading requirements in that file structure that we were looking at before. But the issue is with understanding and knowing what all the team… like, where the teams have put their requirements, because it's either in Confluence, it's in GitHub, it's in a Google Doc, it's in a spreadsheet. Like, each team's, like, built their own way to track all this stuff. But there's no easy way to get it. Right. Back into JAMA, which is the problem that we're trying to solve.
*21:24*

**Dan Maser**: I think that makes sense.
*21:58*

**Gus Schissler**: That's you and me, Dan. Nate, from your perspective, I think… like… If don't hit mailbox leads to, okay, now there's a new library or a new service within the architecture diagram of this whole thing. There's no easy way for them to update what that architecture diagram looks like. So it's not only are the requirements, but it's also, like, okay, what's the cloud… the big picture of the architecture diagram look like, too?
*21:59*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*22:28*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, that seems… okay, that seems, like, really… really simplified. I'm… Have they ever mentioned, like… full, like, seeing this, like, full end-to-end for any single particular team? Like, do they do any of this kind of testing, like, in Michigan? Like, with the vehicle setup? Like, on a track? And they can maybe show us, like, what, you know. I know this wasn't, like, tiled up, but Dan showed me, like, a picture of, like, a car, a vehicle, and it was rigged up with, like, a screen, there was a…
*22:30*

**Gus Schissler**: a driver…
*23:08*

**Nathan Papes**: the car was driving itself, but then, like, I imagine there'd be, like, an incident where driver took over the wheel, and… why did you do that? Well, because he would have, like, hit the mailbox or whatever. So, like, how… I'm guessing, like, how would you log that? Like, and I'm guessing that's where the inconsistencies are? Maybe it's just on board, on the car itself, then they, like, unplug the thing, and then stick it into a computer that then processes it, and it gives you maybe, like. all the events that were fired off in the car at that given point in time, and you had to trace it back to your unit. I assessed them.
*23:10*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean, they… I mean, that's the problem that Woven solves in general. That's why they're a separate company other than Toyota. Like, they have a process in place of understanding…
*23:46*

**Nathan Papes**: Okay.
*23:56*

**Gus Schissler**: Their data and their tests, and we're not really interacting with that.
*23:56*

**Nathan Papes**: -Oh.
*23:59*

**Gus Schissler**: What happens, though, is… So I just describe, like, the perfect scenario where, like, okay, don't hit mailbox, all the teams go out, build all the things they need to make sure their little component fits into that big picture, and then it bubbles back up. Everything tests perfectly, they have all the requirements, everything's checked, and then it gets released to the next… in the next software release for vehicles. That's, like, a perfect waterfall scenario, but we all know that when you're working in software, requirements change based on how much context you have. So the… Nate, what you're talking about is, like, okay. Let's say that the team is testing. Locally on their computers, of like, oh, are we getting the correct mailbox recognition?
*24:01*

**Dan Maser**: testing, I believe, is the correct… yeah, sorry.
*24:52*

**Gus Schissler**: So… And then they discovered, like, oh, like, we're incorrectly thinking billboards are mailboxes, so they need to add a new requirement. and a new test, so the… all of the work that we just did to get all the requirements back up to product delivery has now shifted down at the very bottom of the V, because the team needed to create a new requirement, or a new change. So that each of the teams also has their own shifting requirements, and there's no easy way to make sure those changes are reflected up In the final central repository of what all the changes need to look like.
*24:56*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. So, to the point… keep going.
*25:37*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, the… so, we're not going to… the product delivery team doesn't care At all. about… test data. Or, like, what the teams are doing to test. They care that the teams have requirements, and the teams have tests that fulfill those requirements, and then they're getting either a thumbs up or a thumbs down based on the outcomes of those tests.
*25:40*

**Dan Maser**: And any changes that are, like you just detailed out, any changes that have to be made are correctly documented. And floated upwards, correct?
*26:06*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. And so, that… now is where I'll caveat, like, This is mine. loose understanding of the problem space that we're in right now, and what I'd love to do is… like, I just described a whole user journey as, like. put that up in Miro or FigJam, and show it to Andrea tomorrow, and say, like, Is this right? Where are we wrong in some areas, or something like that?
*26:15*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. Because, exactly, I think… I think that totally makes sense to… to try and diagram that out. And… It is all just one… Big… picture, yeah, yeah. I think… Can I… I don't want to get too off-topic here, but just… Because their thought was, like, small slicing it, which I love, and, like, just starting with one team. Correct, but I'm a little confused because isn't the whole point of this that it gets to integration level? I guess we can still test it on one team, though.
*26:44*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, with the awareness that what we build probably needs to be team agnostic.
*27:25*

**Dan Maser**: Right, that's a… yeah.
*27:31*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah, but… Though they might… we can ask them about that, too. We should write that as a question. We're like, and I don't know where it goes. But… I know. They might just want… they might not have the confidence that this can actually work. Right. So we can automate the… Manual work that they're doing together, both the requirements and the tests from all the all the teams.
*27:33*

**Dan Maser**: Yes. Alright. I know we have 5 minutes left, It's okay, I mean, I have more time to… like, I have a lot of time today. I feel pretty good about where this is going, like, even if we… like, even if it takes us a little bit of time, I think we're good. Like, I feel like we'll be in a good spot for interviewing Andrea tomorrow. Did we plan that out?
*27:58*

**Gus Schissler**: No, but I need to find time.
*28:21*

**Dan Maser**: Let's… really quickly, let's pause the script really quick. What are your thoughts on… because we should probably… I feel like my assumption is if we can get something on our calendar. That shows that we're making good progress. What are you thinking in terms of in-person versus remote conversation with her?
*28:22*

**Gus Schissler**: We should do it remote.
*28:38*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, cool. I'm good with that. Let's… so, let's maybe plan that… I think maybe let's try and schedule that out for tomorrow at some point. Yes. Because I think, like, we can keep… like, obviously these are way too many questions, but I think… I'm with you, Gus, like, the core is, like, I think making the visual, running through the visual with her, and trying to understand, like, these are… these are the elements of it, right? Release and integration flow, change tracking and change logs, requirements and traceability, and then if we can ask… questions on, like, architecture. That would be great, too.
*28:39*

**Gus Schissler**: If you wanted to get them a list of questions, I would just rephrase each of the headers here as a question.
*29:30*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, that's a really good point.
*29:36*

**Gus Schissler**: like, Five questions.
*29:38*

**Dan Maser**: Yep, I think, yeah, I think… I think that's a really good call-out. So just to say it out loud, like, we really want to, like, get the big picture in front of them visually and clarify and verify it, and then specifically ask, like, a question with, like, follow-up questions for release and integration flow. Change tracking and change logs, requirements and traceability, architecture and process and tool basics. there is this… I mean, we kind of just asked, like, how scope looks like. It probably makes sense. I'm just wondering, is there anything that this is missing on, in terms of, like, the core aspects? I mean, we can also ask that as a question.
*29:40*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean, like… I wouldn't get too far into, like, the way I would phrase these questions is more like, like, help us understand the big picture of moving code. in your organization. the release and integration flow, like, I don't want to get even technical as that. It's like, help us understand the role product delivery has in this flow. Yeah, and like, we're… I'd love for us to really just start from… From zero. Basically pretending like we don't know.
*30:19*

**Dan Maser**: Right.
*30:56*

**Gus Schissler**: I need to. Yes. At least for the conversation with Andrea.
*30:57*

**Dan Maser**: Yup.
*31:01*

**Gus Schissler**: Cause I don't… I think we're already ahead of ourselves, and I want to make sure that we're… validating…
*31:03*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*31:12*

**Gus Schissler**: What we think we know.
*31:14*

**Dan Maser**: So… We've got 5 minutes… oh, shit, what time is it? Sometimes my… Dude, sometimes my screen does this where it doesn't update the time. Really?
*31:18*

**Gus Schissler**: I've got 2 minutes before.
*31:27*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, yeah, my monitor says it's 9.40 still. Okay, so that said, let's do the 4 minutes then to… like, so, given that, I'd really like that, Gus. Help us understand the big picture of change tracking and the purpose of change logs within that flow. We can massage that.
*31:29*

**Gus Schissler**: I mean, it's… the easier way to ask that question is, okay, what happens if a team changes something?
*31:44*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah…
*31:48*

**Gus Schissler**: After you've already written it down.
*31:49*

**Dan Maser**: Team changes a requirement.
*31:52*

**Gus Schissler**: Or a test, I think.
*31:55*

**Dan Maser**: After it's already been written down, and that's, like, the example of the billboards, correct?
*31:58*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah.
*32:03*

**Dan Maser**: I know that's internal. Okay. And then requirements and traceability… It's kind of the same…
*32:06*

**Gus Schissler**: It's the same, yeah.
*32:13*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah. I mean, that's kind of, like, the follow-up question of, like, how is that tracked, or how is that…
*32:15*

**Gus Schissler**: Yeah. How do you know about it? Like… Does the team send you a Slack message? Something like that. Do you have to monitor it?
*32:24*

**Dan Maser**: Happens… yup, exactly. What happens next?
*32:34*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah.
*32:39*

**Gus Schissler**: Before I hop, we're all good for that meeting at noon, right?
*32:40*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, that's… that's specifically where Andrea's going through the architecture, correct?
*32:47*

**Nathan Papes**: Overview, our, yeah, our architectural overview is…
*32:51*

**Gus Schissler**: Julia.
*32:54*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, it's Julia? Great. Yep. Yes, I'll… I mean, I think it just makes sense for me to be there to, like, under… yeah, yes.
*32:56*

**Gus Schissler**: I think I marked you as optional.
*33:04*

**Nathan Papes**: Fair enough. What I would love is just, like, Oh, sorry, go ahead.
*33:07*

**Gus Schissler**: You guys, here, I'll make Dan the host, and then you can keep on.
*33:12*

**Dan Maser**: Were we gonna say, Nate? Yeah.
*33:17*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, I was like, I don't know who is the right person to ask this question to, but just thinking of this at, like, a high level without, like, even being technical, it's like… Everything like this is just kind of like, you have inputs, system, which is like the black box, and you have outputs.
*33:20*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah.
*33:36*

**Nathan Papes**: But then you keep repeating that until you have the output that you want. So, if someone could trace that whole line. Like, and just say, like, okay, the input here would be, like, okay, it could be, like, a requirement piece of text. It goes through a system, maybe it's JAMA, that's where it's, like, logged. That's probably not true. And then… That gets maybe triaged to the right team, where they have to go implement it. And then there's, like, code as, like, the input. And then the system is, like, a set of tasks. And then the output is, like, tests fail or pass. If it failed? it gets triage to, like, than what other system? You know what I'm saying? But, like, have it as… very just bullet-pointed, and then, like, kind of circle, like, like, what's the pain in the ass point of, like, what… Like, what you need us for? And I think that's essentially kind of, like, what's… what's here? I'm… maybe I just didn't spend enough time Going through all.
*33:36*

**Dan Maser**: yesterday.
*34:49*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah. Yeah, and I don't even know if this kind of person that would know all that would even exist, because I hear it's very, very, like, siloed off. But if there's, like, that one person, they're like, yeah, what we, like, what's been, like, the pain in the ass for us is, like, you know, this part of the system.
*34:51*

**Dan Maser**: And that might just be, like, the final, like.
*35:12*

**Nathan Papes**: release phase. It sounds like we're kind of high, like, really high up, like, we're… we're really high, like, we're not doing the, you know, the self-driving pieces of it, we're just kind of, like. ensuring all the requirements get met. If they don't get met. We deal with, like, both those cases. And then ultimately, maybe it's, like, a thumbs up. You could say this car can do… has these capabilities.
*35:15*

**Dan Maser**: Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it, because I think you're right. I think that's ultimately where we are at, is we are working with the team that is making sure that everything has been integrated correctly and has the thumbs up to get into the car. There might be a little bit more scope to that, but, like, that, like. Making sure ahead of time that it knows that it's not gonna hit the dog.
*35:42*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah. Yeah, like that, but, like, when we have… and then there's a way of, like, tracing that all the way back through, like. the whole architecture of, like, what it went through. Like, what happened to make that happen?
*36:06*

**Dan Maser**: Because I think, to your point, then, when something fails, it's easier to understand, like, okay, what the hell happened then? And, like, going to your architecture, it's like, oh, okay, I can see these were all… these were all the requirements and how they were created, and so, like, what requirement doesn't make sense? Or what requirement was, like, created, like. that hypothesis was invalidated, right? Like, I think that's kind of, like, what… yeah. That traceability is.
*36:20*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, yeah, because I think that that seems like that'd be a huge thing, is the traceability, and having some kind of standardized format.
*36:46*

**Dan Maser**: Like, what's the.
*36:53*

**Nathan Papes**: data interchange between, like, each one of these systems, that's doing the testing, and it… some of it might involve people, maybe some of it doesn't, I don't know, because, like, is it… are we just strictly working in, like, the simulated land, or is this also… I imagine there's a piece, like. it has to go through, like, rigorous, like, simulation tasks, which I imagine just run, like, they probably just take forever to run, but super important, and then… Then you would say, okay, like, we're gonna do some tests with humans in the car, and then they probably have a little list That they want to fulfill with one of their driving sessions.
*36:54*

**Dan Maser**: Yes, sorry, I'm pulling up Zoom. Yes, I agree. Alright, well, I have to run… I'm trying to… here, let me stop sharing, I'm trying to make sure that, yeah, this is being recorded, sweet. Okay. Yes. I have more time later today that we'll get these out, and I'll work, like, we can work asynchronously with Gus that we have that interview ready to go, but I feel like it's taking shape a little bit. I'm gonna watch that video. And go from there.
*37:36*

**Nathan Papes**: Okay. That video, you sent that to me in Slack, right?
*38:06*

**Dan Maser**: I don't… .
*38:12*

**Nathan Papes**: Or do you send me the…
*38:14*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, I sent you the transcript, I don't know if you have access… this is… this is where it's annoying.
*38:16*

**Nathan Papes**: Is this the access to the, computer, or is this access to just get, Obsidian?
*38:21*

**Dan Maser**: This is… no, this video is like… I don't have… this… the video is, like, you need an account, so that's why I don't know if you can watch it. That's where it's a pain.
*38:27*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh, okay. If you, I mean, if you… so let's say I know, like, if you can load it in your browser, there's a way, usually, you can, like, inspect the, like, the source code, and then you can probably see, like, what the video name is, like, something.mp4, whatever.
*38:38*

**Dan Maser**: Even if it's locked down, security-wise.
*38:56*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, because you already authenticated, so you should, you should be able to, because, yeah, it's like…
*38:58*

**Dan Maser**: Leave me.
*39:04*

**Nathan Papes**: What you do is you right-click the request that gets the video, copy it as a curl request, drop that in your terminal, and then you can have it downloaded.
*39:05*

**Dan Maser**: Here, here, here, here, sorry, I wasn't talking, that's the video. Okay, so here's the video. How would I…
*39:14*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah, okay, so you're… okay, so, browser tools?
*39:23*

**Dan Maser**: Oh, yeah, so you can do those three dots in order. Oh, sorry, sorry, I haven't… I keep accidentally hitting play, and then I hear multiple voices, and I'm like, this isn't helpful. Okay.
*39:27*

**Nathan Papes**: Cool. Alright, so what should happen here, your network tab? Oh. Okay. Yep, here, okay, let's see, what looks like a video file name? Unless it's just straight up streaming it. channel…
*39:38*

**Dan Maser**: Right here.
*39:55*

**Nathan Papes**: That looks like that might be it, let's see. Oh, nope, that's, that's source code. Boo… hold on. Watch timeline…
*39:56*

**Dan Maser**: Here, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
*40:09*

**Nathan Papes**: manual playback… Yeah, it might… if you refresh the whole thing, it might actually be easier.
*40:10*

**Dan Maser**: Mmm… it's gone. Why did it disappear? Where'd it go? Let me… Where is it? One sec, sorry. It is… This. Okay, here we go. Just gonna hold onto that. Okay. How's that? Player CSS?
*40:21*

**Nathan Papes**: Nope, that's CSS. I'll say… I'll say what the media type is, as one of those columns, too. So, like, so you said PNG there, there should be something that says, like, video, some kind of video format. I imagine it's higher up.
*41:05*

**Dan Maser**: WebP?
*41:20*

**Nathan Papes**: That could be… yes, what P sounds like that's a video.
*41:21*

**Dan Maser**: So should I click on… It's cache on disk.
*41:24*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh yeah, yeah, okay, so left… left-click, or right-click the file name, like, that big long string.
*41:27*

**Dan Maser**: This one right here, or this over here?
*41:33*

**Nathan Papes**: Right there, right there. Alright, copy, ask Curl. Okay, do that. Now go open up, like, a terminal. Like, within… yeah, yeah, like this.
*41:35*

**Dan Maser**: Sorry, I'm just moving it over… where… sorry, I'm on the wrong screen. One second. One moment…
*41:50*

**Nathan Papes**: This'll tell us if, like, their security's actually digit or not, or then paste. Alright, now, just hit enter and see what you get back from it. Moved? Okay, so then that's… It redirected you to… okay, CDN, it looks like. Here, the document was moved here. Copy that… that, that file, yeah, yeah. Just that URL, right there, yep. And throw it in a browser, and see, see what that is.
*42:00*

**Dan Maser**: Go browser, see what it does? Okay.
*42:39*

**Nathan Papes**: Yeah. I have a feeling this is where it's gonna say you're not authenticated to… Whatever.
*42:41*

**Dan Maser**: Not authenticated? Oh.
*42:50*

**Nathan Papes**: Shit, okay, wait, is that just the picture of the video?
*42:52*

**Dan Maser**: Just the picture!
*42:55*

**Nathan Papes**: Goddammit. Yeah. This probably… okay, never mind.
*42:57*

**Dan Maser**: Go to the transcript if you want to read through the transcript, and then we can meet up later. This is so frustrating that you don't have a laptop.
*43:03*

**Nathan Papes**: I know. The whole thing with Dylan's, too, is it's like, give me Dylan's, because he… I'm pretty sure he didn't do jack shit on his. No, maybe he did, but…
*43:11*

**Dan Maser**: That just would have been, like, the most convenient thing to do. Let me look at Gus's calendar and see, because I have some other shit to do, but… Alright. Gus…
*43:20*

**Nathan Papes**: So, but you… you were watching that within, like, Confluence, or was that Google Teams? Like, what was that?
*43:36*

**Dan Maser**: I was watching it through, like, it's like a Google account that they made. Did Muhammad give you an account yet?
*43:42*

**Nathan Papes**: No, he has not… if I… if it was, like, through email or whatever, no, I've not… I haven't received anything through email from Muhammad yet.
*43:48*

**Dan Maser**: Okay, well, we have something at 12… oh, we have something at 12. We can poke Gus and see what makes sense to do. I'm gonna run, but I'll… yeah, I'll poke you, and we'll probably just meet up later this.
*43:58*

**Nathan Papes**: Okay.
*44:11*

**Dan Maser**: later this afternoon or earlier in the morning, but let me just… I just have to respond to, like, 8 different things, but I'll keep you posted.
*44:11*

**Nathan Papes**: Let's do… let's do this afternoon… afternoon after this meeting, I'm gonna look at the emails, too, because I know… I know Sam has been, like, poking this… Sweet. He poked it about 3 times now. So, it was 6 days ago, 1 day ago, and then I saw him do it yesterday, too, so I'm like… and we're just not even getting response… responses, so…
*44:19*

**Dan Maser**: Okay.
*44:43*

**Nathan Papes**: Oh.
*44:44*

**Dan Maser**: We'll do that. I'm gonna run, but I'll chat with you later. Yeah, sounds good. Alright. Let me pause the recording. I'll see you later.
*44:44*

**Nathan Papes**: Yep, bye.
*44:51*
