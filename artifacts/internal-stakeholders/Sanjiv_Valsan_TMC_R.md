# Sanjiv Valsan

## 1. Basic Information
- **Role/Title**: R for TMC (role title abbreviated in sources; “Sanjeev” also used)
- **Department**: Not specified (aligned with systems/product workshop)
- **Location**: Not specified
- **Reports To**: Not specified

## 2. Role Summary
Sanjiv has a strong grasp of what the systems side needs from the requirements tooling initiative. He pulled together a lot of the information from the PdM <> Systems workshop into a chart and is a good source for the consolidated view of intake, sources, and next steps that came out of that workshop.

## 3. Project Involvement
- **Stake in Project**: Understanding and alignment on how requirements flow from product (e.g. PRDs) into systems and JAMA; workshop outcomes and process.
- **Level of Influence**: Medium–High (informed by workshop ownership and chart)
- **Decision Authority**: Not clearly stated; contributes to “what we need” and workshop-derived decisions.
- **Time Commitment**: On the interview list for Atomic; likely available for focused sessions rather than daily standups.

## 4. Goals and Success Criteria
- Clear picture of intake and sources (e.g. PRDs as consolidated list) and how the tooling project fits.
- Alignment between product and systems on where requirements live and how they are consumed.
- Success likely aligns with Julia’s and Andrea’s: single place for requirements, version control, and traceability to TMC.

## 5. Concerns and Pain Points
- Not explicitly called out in the sources; inferred from workshop context (version control, multiple sources, format).

## 6. Communication Preferences
- **Preferred Channels**: Not specified; included in list of people to interview (with Julia, Andrea).
- **Frequency**: Ad hoc / interview and workshop follow-up.
- **Detail Level**: Can provide “pretty good understanding” of what’s needed; chart and workshop summary are key artifacts.

## 7. Key Relationships
- **Works Closely With**: Julia Pralle, Andrea Zotelli (both suggested adding him to the interview list); product side (workshop was PdM <> Systems).
- **Potential Conflicts**: None noted.
- **Influence Network**: Informs Julia and Andrea; good single conversation for Atomic to get workshop-derived context without watching all sessions.

## 8. Engagement Strategy
- Include him in discovery/interview plan; one or two focused sessions to capture his chart and workshop takeaways.
- Use him to validate and supplement Julia’s and Andrea’s picture of intake, sources, and priorities.
- Ask for a copy or walkthrough of the chart he created so Atomic can align on the same “map” of requirements flow.

## 9. Notes and Context
- Workshop was “three weeks ago” (relative to 2026-02-23); they landed on PRDs as the place product will consolidate requirements on a quarterly basis.
- Project Details list him on “who get to know” for Epic 1 (Julia, Andrea, Hannah, Sanjiv).
