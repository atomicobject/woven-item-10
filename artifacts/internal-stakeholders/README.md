# Internal Stakeholder Map — Systems Engineering Tooling Support

Stakeholder profiles for the Woven/Atomic engagement on systems engineering tooling (requirements → JAMA, dynamic architecture diagram). Use for project planning and relationship management.

## Project Context

Pilot (Q4 into Q1): systems engineering tooling to generate consistent architectural, requirement, and test artifacts from code and documentation. Key outcomes: requirements in JAMA with version control and traceability; dynamic architecture diagram from IP codebase; optional test traceability later. Primary client stakeholders are on the systems side (requirements tooling team, systems/product boundary) and need a single source of truth and change detection for requirements flowing from Git, JAMA, and product PRDs to the IP JAMA project for TMC communication.

## Stakeholder Index

| Stakeholder | Role focus | Influence | Key for |
|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| [Julia Pralle](Julia_Pralle_Requirements_Tooling_Lead.md) | Requirements tooling lead | High | Scope, priorities, client contact |
| [Andrea Zotelli](Andrea_Zotelli_Systems_Requirements.md) | Systems/requirements (component-level) | High | JAMA structure, transfer, access |
| [Sanjiv Valsan](Sanjiv_Valsan_TMC_R.md) | TMC R; workshop chart owner | Medium–High | Workshop context, intake view |
| [Hannah Lane](Hannah_Lane_Systems.md) | Systems (tenure 1+ year) | Medium (assumed) | Veteran perspective; interview |
| [Eric Keranen](Eric_Keranen_Architecture_Tooling.md) | Prior architecture tooling | Medium | Epic 2 reuse/adaptation |
