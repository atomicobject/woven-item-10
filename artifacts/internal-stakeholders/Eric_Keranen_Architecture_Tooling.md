# Eric Keranen

## 1. Basic Information
- **Role/Title**: Not specified (tech guild / prior tooling)
- **Department**: Not specified (likely tech guild or platform)
- **Location**: Not specified
- **Reports To**: Not specified

## 2. Role Summary
Eric is the person to ask about an older tool that was used (or considered) for architecture diagramming. Julia plans to clarify with him whether that tool can be re-used for Epic 2 (architecture diagram from current IP codebase that updates dynamically with version control and traceability).

## 3. Project Involvement
- **Stake in Project**: Epic 2—dynamic architecture diagram from codebase; potential reuse of existing tooling.
- **Level of Influence**: Medium (gatekeeper to prior solution; can accelerate or simplify Epic 2).
- **Decision Authority**: Knowledge of prior tool; whether it can be re-used or adapted.
- **Time Commitment**: Likely ad hoc (one or few conversations) unless reuse leads to ongoing collaboration.

## 4. Goals and Success Criteria
- Not specified; assumed interest in not duplicating work and in consistent tooling where possible.

## 5. Concerns and Pain Points
- Not specified.

## 6. Communication Preferences
- Not specified; coordination via Julia (she will clarify with him).

## 7. Key Relationships
- **Works Closely With**: Julia Pralle (she will follow up with him); likely tech guild or similar.
- **Influence Network**: Can unblock or shortcut Epic 2 if the old tool is viable.

## 8. Engagement Strategy
- Let Julia take the first step (“Julia to clarify with Eric if that could be re-used”); Atomic can then engage Eric for technical details once Julia has confirmed interest in reuse.
- If re-use is possible, involve him in Epic 2 scope and constraints (inputs, outputs, versioning) so the new solution aligns with existing patterns.
- If re-use is not feasible, ask for lessons learned or artifacts that could inform a new solution.

## 9. Notes and Context
- Project Details (Epic 2): “We had a tool a while ago—Julia Pralle to clarify with Eric Keranen if that could be re-used. Then we could explore to adapt the old tool to work again or create a new solution.”
