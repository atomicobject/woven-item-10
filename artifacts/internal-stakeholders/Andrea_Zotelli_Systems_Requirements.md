# Andrea Zotelli

## 1. Basic Information
- **Role/Title**: Systems / requirements (component-level requirements from capabilities)
- **Department**: Systems engineering
- **Location**: Not specified (global; has schedule conflicts in 1–2 p.m. window)
- **Tenure**: Started October 2025
- **Reports To**: Not specified

## 2. Role Summary
Andrea does the hands-on work of taking higher-level capabilities and distilling them down to component-level requirements, and she is the main person who can guide how requirements are written in Git and in JAMA and how to transfer them into the IP JAMA project. She has been the first point of contact for Atomic on access and permissions and is critical for JAMA structure and mapping from sources.

## 3. Project Involvement
- **Stake in Project**: Success of the tooling directly affects her day-to-day workload; she has a “massive” backlog and needs better structure (single source of truth, change detection, fewer ad hoc access/version issues).
- **Level of Influence**: High on execution and format
- **Decision Authority**: JAMA structure and transfer rules; guidance on requirement format (Git vs JAMA); access and “who to ask” for source documents.
- **Time Commitment**: High—daily standups, overviews, and ad hoc help; she has recurring conflicts Mon/Thu 1–2 p.m. (prefers standups after 10 a.m. Julia’s time).

## 4. Goals and Success Criteria
- One place to document requirements with links to sources and clear version/approval so the team is not “always trying to have an access sheet.”
- Tooling that helps get requirements into JAMA in the right shape and that flags when source requirements change.
- Some form of checklist or “denominator” (e.g. capabilities list) so she knows what components need requirements and in what order (or at least which are most TBD).
- Success from her perspective may emphasize “getting out of the hole” (backlog) and reducing chaos rather than only “communication” to TMC.

## 5. Concerns and Pain Points
- No clear checklist of what she needs to do; it’s unclear how many components need requirements.
- Every situation feels novel; no standard pattern or prioritization (e.g. “this component is 90% TBD, work on that one” would help).
- Backlog is very large; job is highly demanding with constant change and many sources.
- She has not looked deeply at Reqtify yet (only “the first page”); product is considering it for traceability.
- Asked Atomic “what do you guys think the problem you’re solving is?”—suggests possible misalignment or different framing vs Julia; worth confirming with both.

## 6. Communication Preferences
- **Preferred Channels**: Slack (very responsive), meetings (standups, overviews); first point of contact for access and links.
- **Frequency**: Daily standups when possible; ad hoc as needed for permissions and format questions.
- **Detail Level**: Can go into detail on Git vs JAMA format and transfer; needs concrete examples (e.g. “good example of requirements you’ve written and the documentation you looked at”).
- **Best Times**: Avoid 1–2 p.m. on Mon/Thu; standups moved to 10 a.m. Julia’s time to accommodate her.

## 7. Key Relationships
- **Works Closely With**: Julia Pralle (priorities and scope), Sanjiv Valsan (workshop context), product for source requirements; Atomic (Dan, Gus) for access and discovery.
- **Potential Conflicts**: Her framing of the problem (backlog, lack of checklist, prioritization) may not fully match Julia’s; discovery with Julia recommended to compare.
- **Influence Network**: Primary guide for Atomic on JAMA and sources; if Atomic doesn’t have access to a doc, “send her the link” and she can help get access.

## 8. Engagement Strategy
- Treat her as the main SME for JAMA structure, transfer logic, and requirement format; ask for examples of well-written requirements and the source docs she used.
- Follow up on the “capabilities spreadsheet” she mentioned to establish a denominator/checklist (e.g. lane change, other capabilities) even if loose at first.
- Run parallel discovery with Julia to compare perspectives and align on “the problem we’re solving.”
- Use her for access and link requests; keep her in the loop on Reqtify evaluation once she has capacity.
- Avoid overloading her; any tooling that reduces manual version/access tracking will directly help her.

## 9. Notes and Context
- Andrea helped Atomic with access; Dan and Gus noted she was “fantastic” and “the first” to help.
- Reqtify: JP team may use it; she has not evaluated it in depth; could be part of the solution.
- Project Details name her as primary contact for Epic 1 (“please work with Andrea Zotelli”) and for JAMA structure guidance; she is on the “who get to know” list with Julia, Hannah, Sanjiv.
