# Julia Pralle

## 1. Basic Information
- **Role/Title**: Lead for requirements tooling / systems (requirement tooling team)
- **Department**: Systems / product–systems boundary
- **Location**: Not specified (global team; time zone referenced relative to US)
- **Reports To**: Not specified

## 2. Role Summary
Julia owns the requirements tooling team and the vision for how requirements flow from multiple sources (Git, JAMA, product PRDs) into a single JAMA project with version control and traceability. She drives the SOW and epic-level scope, coordinates with product on intake (e.g. quarterly PRD list), and delegates detailed JAMA structure and transfer logic to Andrea. She is the primary client contact for Atomic on this engagement.

## 3. Project Involvement
- **Stake in Project**: Needs a single input (e.g. table or PRD) that can be transferred into the IP JAMA project, with change detection and ideally dynamic updates when source requirements change. Version control and traceability are critical for communicating requirements status to the customer (TMC).
- **Level of Influence**: High
- **Decision Authority**: Scope and priorities for requirements tooling; interview list and key contacts; acceptance of tooling approach and inputs/outputs.
- **Time Commitment**: Regular (daily standups, overview sessions, ad hoc Slack); open to adjusting cadence (e.g. 10 a.m. her time, or two longer sessions per week instead of daily).

## 4. Goals and Success Criteria
- One consolidated input (e.g. table with links to sources) that feeds into JAMA so the team is “independent from the problem” of access sheets and version approval.
- Requirements from Git and other JAMA projects transferred into the IP JAMA project with correct formatting and linkage.
- Minimum: know when something in the original source changes (e.g. “these five requirements changed yesterday”); best case: automatic propagation and versioning in JAMA.
- Reuse or align with product’s direction (e.g. Reqtify) if it fits; explore with Andrea and team.

## 5. Concerns and Pain Points
- Version control is “really messy” today; team is “always trying to have an access sheet” and approval to ensure correct versions.
- Many requirements link to different sources; format and intake from product “changing on a constant manner.”
- Workshop with product was dense (acronyms, multiple days); wrap-up session is the clearest artifact for outsiders.
- Does not see the first epic’s detailed implementation as her main problem—“that’s not my problem right now”—and defers to Andrea for JAMA transfer and structure.

## 6. Communication Preferences
- **Preferred Channels**: Shared documents (e.g. Google Docs with SOW, examples, notes), Slack, video calls (standups, overviews).
- **Frequency**: Daily standups (or two longer sessions per week); responsive on Slack.
- **Detail Level**: High-level flow and goals; delegates detailed format/JAMA guidance to Andrea (and Sanjiv for workshop-derived context).
- **Best Times**: Flexible; moved standups to 10 a.m. her time to accommodate Andrea’s conflicts.

## 7. Key Relationships
- **Works Closely With**: Andrea Zotelli (JAMA structure, transfer rules, Reqtify), Sanjiv Valsan (workshop outcomes, chart of intake/needs), product (PRDs, quarterly list), Nate (Atomic) for architecture diagram (Epic 2).
- **Potential Conflicts**: Perspective may differ from Andrea’s (e.g. “communication problem” vs execution/backlog); Atomic noted value in running similar discovery with Julia to compare.
- **Influence Network**: Sets who Atomic should interview (Andrea, Sanjiv); connects to product and Kevin/Daniel for impact statements; can share workshop recordings/transcripts and meeting notes.

## 8. Engagement Strategy
- Use her as the primary point for scope, priorities, and “what good looks like” for requirements tooling; confirm understanding of the problem in her terms (e.g. one input → JAMA, version/change visibility).
- Schedule dedicated discovery/user interviews with her (separate from Andrea) to capture her perspective and compare with Andrea’s.
- Request workshop wrap-up recording and notes (and transcripts if available) for context; avoid relying on full multi-day workshop for first pass.
- Keep her informed as Atomic learns (Slack, short updates); she is open to flexible cadence if it improves depth of communication.

## 9. Notes and Context
- She added the list of people Atomic should talk to (Andrea, Sanjiv) and offered to add workshop links to the meeting notes.
- Architecture diagram (Epic 2): she will discuss with Nate; prior tool may exist—Julia to clarify with Eric Keranen if it can be re-used.
- Main requirement sources for the engagement: Git repository and JAMA; product moving to quarterly PRD list as consolidated intake.
